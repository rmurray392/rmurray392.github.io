Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:
• Aggravated DUI — Causing personal injury or death as a result of a DUI; having a prior
conviction of reckless homicide or aggravated DUI involving a death and committing a
DUI; receiving a third or subsequent DUI conviction; committing a DUI without a valid license,
permit or vehicle insurance; or committing a DUI violation while transporting children

Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Downgrade
This sign warns a driver of a dangerous hill. It may be very long or
steep, or it may have sharp curves. Drivers should slow their speed
before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

CONSTRUCTION
72
Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot
brake must be strong enough to stop a vehicle traveling at a speed of 20 mph within 30
feet. The emergency or parking brake must be strong enough to stop the vehicle in 55
feet at the same speed. The emergency brake also must be able to hold the vehicle on a
grade or hill. Motor-driven cycles need only one brake.
• Headlights — Vehicles must have two headlights and they must be on from sunset to
sunrise and be used in times when rain, snow, fog or other conditions require the use of
windshield wipers. They also should be used when objects 1,000 feet away cannot be
seen. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300
feet before passing a vehicle. Motorcycles and mopeds require a headlight, which must
show objects 500 feet ahead, and be turned on whenever the vehicle is driven.
• Taillights — Vehicles must have two red lights visible for 500 feet from behind. Only
one taillight is needed for mopeds and motorcycles.
• Turn signals — Vehicles, except motorcycles, trailers and semitrailers, must have right
and left-turn signals on the front and rear visible from 300 feet.
• License plate light — Vehicles must have a white light making the license plate readable
from 50 feet away and must be on when headlights are on.
• Parking lights — Front and rear parking lights are required for any vehicle stopped on
a highway at night. Some local communities may allow unlighted night parking on streets.
• Safety Belts— Passenger vehicles must have two sets of safety belts in the front seat.
Vehicles manufactured in 1965 or after may not be sold or operated in Illinois without
safety belts.
• Mirrors — One rearview mirror is required so the driver can see at least 200 feet behind
the car.
• Windows — All window glass must be approved safety glass. The windshield must be
free of snow, ice, moisture and any defects that distort vision. All glass must be free of
obstructions between the driver and front or rear windows. Tinted windows are not allowed
on the front windshield. A 6-inch strip of tinting is allowed along the entire length
at the top of the front windshield.
• Wipers — Wipers must operate properly to clear ice, snow and moisture.
• Horn — Vehicles must have a horn that can be heard from 200 feet. Sirens, whistles
and bells are allowed only on authorized emergency vehicles.
• Muffler — A muffler must be on the exhaust system to prevent excessive noise and
smoke. Cutouts, bypasses and changes to the system to increase noise are illegal.
• Bumpers — Vehicles weighing 9,000 pounds or less and all recreational vehicles must

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.

As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.

About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill
34

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:

Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

YIELD
65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Intersections Ahead
These four signs warn a driver of intersections ahead where traffic may exist, or a right or
left turn may be required. A sign naming the intersecting road also may be posted.
Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot
brake must be strong enough to stop a vehicle traveling at a speed of 20 mph within 30
feet. The emergency or parking brake must be strong enough to stop the vehicle in 55
feet at the same speed. The emergency brake also must be able to hold the vehicle on a

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER #2
Employees ages 16 and under MAY NOT drive motor vehicles on public roads as part of

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at

Chapter 1: Illinois Driver’s License
To drive legally in Illinois, residents must have a valid Illinois driver’s license, temporary
visitor driver’s license, probationary license, instruction permit, Restricted Driving Permit or
Monitoring Device Driving Permit and must carry it with them while operating a motor vehicle.
To obtain a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility, show required identification documents and have a photo
taken.
• Surrender all Illinois or out-of-state licenses, including commercial driver’s licenses, state
ID cards and instruction permits.
• Pay the appropriate fee.
• Pass the appropriate exams (vision screening, written and/or driving).
• Provide a valid address for the mailing of the permanent driver’s license.
Age Restrictions — Drivers 16-21
Applicants must be at least age 18 to obtain an Illinois driver’s license. The following exceptions
apply:
• Applicants age 16 or 17 may receive their license if they successfully complete a stateapproved
driver education course, complete 50 hours of practice driving and pass the
three parts of the driver’s license exam. If a parent cannot accompany a minor to the facility,
an Affidavit/Consent for Minor to Drive must be signed by a legal guardian or a responsible
adult over age 21. For more information about obtaining a driver’s license before
age 18, see page 16.
• If the individual is a first-time Illinois driver’s license applicant, age 18, 19 or 20 and has
never been licensed or completed an approved high school or commercial school driver
education program, he/she must successfully complete a six-hour Adult Driver Education
Course through a Secretary of State certified adult driver education provider before obtaining

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be

Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;

Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18

Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.
Figure A

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.

Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:

• Uninsured Crashes — Being an at-fault driver in a traffic crash without insurance
where damages are owed.
• Zero Tolerance Violation — An alcohol violation by a person under age 21.
Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER #2
Employees ages 16 and under MAY NOT drive motor vehicles on public roads as part of
their jobs.
Employees age 17 may drive cars and small trucks on public roads as part of their employment,
but ONLY if all the following requirements are met:
• The driving is limited to daylight hours.
• The 17-year-old holds a state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed.
• The 17-year-old has successfully completed a state-approved driver education course
and has no record of any moving violation at the time of hire.
• The automobile or truck is equipped with safety belts for the driver and any passengers
and the employer has instructed the youth that the safety belts must be used when driving
the vehicle.
• The automobile or truck does not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.
9
More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.

Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.

No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:
• Aggravated DUI — Causing personal injury or death as a result of a DUI; having a prior
conviction of reckless homicide or aggravated DUI involving a death and committing a
DUI; receiving a third or subsequent DUI conviction; committing a DUI without a valid license,
permit or vehicle insurance; or committing a DUI violation while transporting children
on a school bus.
• Aggravated Fleeing the Police — Driving away from the police when directed to stop.
• Aggravated Reckless Driving — Driving resulting in great bodily harm, permanent
disability or disfigurement to another person.
• Auto Theft — Stealing a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts.
• Drag Racing or Street Racing — Illegally racing with another vehicle.
• DUI — Driving under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, other drugs and/or intoxicating
compounds.
• Felony Offense — Using a vehicle while committing a serious crime.
• Fraudulent ID — Making or possessing the equipment to make, sell, use, attempt to
use or assist another in using an unauthorized, non-governmental issued ID or driver’s license.
• Gang-related Activity — A gang-related offense involving the use of a vehicle or an
Illinois driver’s license.
• Leaving the Scene — Leaving the scene of a crash that killed or injured someone.
• Perjury — Giving false information to the Secretary of State.
• Reckless Conduct — Reckless behavior involving a vehicle and resulting in injury or
danger to another person.
58
• Reckless Driving — Conviction of three reckless driving offenses in 12 months or driving
that results in great bodily harm, permanent disability or disfigurement to another
person.
• Reckless Homicide — Driving recklessly, resulting in the death of another person or
being involved in a crash where a death occurred while driving on a suspended or revoked
license due to an aggravated DUI .
• School Bus Violation — Conviction for overtaking or passing a school bus that results
in a crash where a death occurred.
Suspension
A suspension is the temporary loss of driving privileges. When the suspension is for a specific
length of time, a driver may regain driving privileges after the suspension has ended
and a reinstatement fee has been paid. In some cases, the driver’s license will not be returned
until other requirements are met.
Offenses for which a driver’s license may be suspended include, but are not limited to:
• Automated Traffic Violations — Failure to pay five or more unpaid automated traffic
violations for violating a red-light signal or speeding or a combination thereof in a municipality.
• Causing a Crash in a Construction Zone — Failure to reduce speed or change lanes

More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Downgrade
This sign warns a driver of a dangerous hill. It may be very long or
steep, or it may have sharp curves. Drivers should slow their speed
before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

CONSTRUCTION
72
Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot
brake must be strong enough to stop a vehicle traveling at a speed of 20 mph within 30
feet. The emergency or parking brake must be strong enough to stop the vehicle in 55
feet at the same speed. The emergency brake also must be able to hold the vehicle on a
grade or hill. Motor-driven cycles need only one brake.
• Headlights — Vehicles must have two headlights and they must be on from sunset to
sunrise and be used in times when rain, snow, fog or other conditions require the use of
windshield wipers. They also should be used when objects 1,000 feet away cannot be
seen. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300
feet before passing a vehicle. Motorcycles and mopeds require a headlight, which must
show objects 500 feet ahead, and be turned on whenever the vehicle is driven.
• Taillights — Vehicles must have two red lights visible for 500 feet from behind. Only
one taillight is needed for mopeds and motorcycles.
• Turn signals — Vehicles, except motorcycles, trailers and semitrailers, must have right
and left-turn signals on the front and rear visible from 300 feet.
• License plate light — Vehicles must have a white light making the license plate readable
from 50 feet away and must be on when headlights are on.
• Parking lights — Front and rear parking lights are required for any vehicle stopped on
a highway at night. Some local communities may allow unlighted night parking on streets.
• Safety Belts— Passenger vehicles must have two sets of safety belts in the front seat.
Vehicles manufactured in 1965 or after may not be sold or operated in Illinois without
safety belts.
• Mirrors — One rearview mirror is required so the driver can see at least 200 feet behind
the car.
• Windows — All window glass must be approved safety glass. The windshield must be
free of snow, ice, moisture and any defects that distort vision. All glass must be free of
obstructions between the driver and front or rear windows. Tinted windows are not allowed
on the front windshield. A 6-inch strip of tinting is allowed along the entire length
at the top of the front windshield.
• Wipers — Wipers must operate properly to clear ice, snow and moisture.
• Horn — Vehicles must have a horn that can be heard from 200 feet. Sirens, whistles
and bells are allowed only on authorized emergency vehicles.
• Muffler — A muffler must be on the exhaust system to prevent excessive noise and
smoke. Cutouts, bypasses and changes to the system to increase noise are illegal.
• Bumpers — Vehicles weighing 9,000 pounds or less and all recreational vehicles must

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and

Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.

Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Intersections Ahead
These four signs warn a driver of intersections ahead where traffic may exist, or a right or

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Downgrade
This sign warns a driver of a dangerous hill. It may be very long or
steep, or it may have sharp curves. Drivers should slow their speed
before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot
brake must be strong enough to stop a vehicle traveling at a speed of 20 mph within 30
feet. The emergency or parking brake must be strong enough to stop the vehicle in 55
feet at the same speed. The emergency brake also must be able to hold the vehicle on a
grade or hill. Motor-driven cycles need only one brake.
• Headlights — Vehicles must have two headlights and they must be on from sunset to
sunrise and be used in times when rain, snow, fog or other conditions require the use of
windshield wipers. They also should be used when objects 1,000 feet away cannot be
seen. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300
feet before passing a vehicle. Motorcycles and mopeds require a headlight, which must
show objects 500 feet ahead, and be turned on whenever the vehicle is driven.
• Taillights — Vehicles must have two red lights visible for 500 feet from behind. Only
one taillight is needed for mopeds and motorcycles.
• Turn signals — Vehicles, except motorcycles, trailers and semitrailers, must have right
and left-turn signals on the front and rear visible from 300 feet.
• License plate light — Vehicles must have a white light making the license plate readable
from 50 feet away and must be on when headlights are on.
• Parking lights — Front and rear parking lights are required for any vehicle stopped on
a highway at night. Some local communities may allow unlighted night parking on streets.
• Safety Belts— Passenger vehicles must have two sets of safety belts in the front seat.
Vehicles manufactured in 1965 or after may not be sold or operated in Illinois without
safety belts.
• Mirrors — One rearview mirror is required so the driver can see at least 200 feet behind
the car.
• Windows — All window glass must be approved safety glass. The windshield must be
free of snow, ice, moisture and any defects that distort vision. All glass must be free of
obstructions between the driver and front or rear windows. Tinted windows are not allowed
on the front windshield. A 6-inch strip of tinting is allowed along the entire length
at the top of the front windshield.
• Wipers — Wipers must operate properly to clear ice, snow and moisture.
• Horn — Vehicles must have a horn that can be heard from 200 feet. Sirens, whistles
and bells are allowed only on authorized emergency vehicles.
• Muffler — A muffler must be on the exhaust system to prevent excessive noise and
smoke. Cutouts, bypasses and changes to the system to increase noise are illegal.
• Bumpers — Vehicles weighing 9,000 pounds or less and all recreational vehicles must
have a front and rear bumper. It is illegal to alter the suspension system of a vehicle to
89
lift the body from the chassis frame in excess of 3 inches. The horizontal line from the
front to the rear may not vary over 3 inches.
Restricted Equipment
• Projecting Loads — Loads extending 4 feet or more to the rear of a vehicle must be
marked with a red flag during the day. At night or when visibility is poor, the vehicle must
have a red light visible for 500 feet.
• Back-up lights — Vehicles may have one or more backup lights; however, they may
not be on when the vehicle is moving forward.
• Spotlights — Only one spotlight is allowed on a vehicle. When approaching another
vehicle, it must be directed neither to the left nor more than 100 feet ahead. A vehicle
may not have more than four 300 candlepower lights burning.
• Flashing or moving lights — Flashing or moving lights other than turn signals or hazard

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER #2
Employees ages 16 and under MAY NOT drive motor vehicles on public roads as part of

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).

State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.

during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.

conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement

Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.
Figure A
Figure C Figure D
Figure B
28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.

suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit

• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.

Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 800-252-8980.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER #2
Employees ages 16 and under MAY NOT drive motor vehicles on public roads as part of
their jobs.
Employees age 17 may drive cars and small trucks on public roads as part of their employment,
but ONLY if all the following requirements are met:
• The driving is limited to daylight hours.
• The 17-year-old holds a state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed.
• The 17-year-old has successfully completed a state-approved driver education course
and has no record of any moving violation at the time of hire.
• The automobile or truck is equipped with safety belts for the driver and any passengers

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.
9
More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:
• Aggravated DUI — Causing personal injury or death as a result of a DUI; having a prior

Suspension
A suspension is the temporary loss of driving privileges. When the suspension is for a specific
length of time, a driver may regain driving privileges after the suspension has ended
and a reinstatement fee has been paid. In some cases, the driver’s license will not be returned
until other requirements are met.
Offenses for which a driver’s license may be suspended include, but are not limited to:
• Automated Traffic Violations — Failure to pay five or more unpaid automated traffic

suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.
— Chapter 8 Study Questions —
1. An individual’s driving privileges may be suspended under which of the following conditions?
a. Three reckless driving offenses in 12 months.
b. Drag or street racing.
c. Illegally transporting alcohol twice in 12 months by a person over age 21.
2. Driving privileges may be revoked for giving false information to the Secretary of State.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Downgrade
This sign warns a driver of a dangerous hill. It may be very long or
steep, or it may have sharp curves. Drivers should slow their speed
before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

CONSTRUCTION
72
Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.
Jesse White
Illinois Secretary of State
Illinois Rules of the Road 2018
Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.

suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit

• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP
STOP
YIELD
65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot

• Parking lights — Front and rear parking lights are required for any vehicle stopped on
a highway at night. Some local communities may allow unlighted night parking on streets.
• Safety Belts— Passenger vehicles must have two sets of safety belts in the front seat.
Vehicles manufactured in 1965 or after may not be sold or operated in Illinois without
safety belts.
• Mirrors — One rearview mirror is required so the driver can see at least 200 feet behind
the car.
• Windows — All window glass must be approved safety glass. The windshield must be
free of snow, ice, moisture and any defects that distort vision. All glass must be free of
obstructions between the driver and front or rear windows. Tinted windows are not allowed
on the front windshield. A 6-inch strip of tinting is allowed along the entire length
at the top of the front windshield.

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 800-252-8980.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER #2
Employees ages 16 and under MAY NOT drive motor vehicles on public roads as part of
their jobs.
Employees age 17 may drive cars and small trucks on public roads as part of their employment,
but ONLY if all the following requirements are met:
• The driving is limited to daylight hours.
• The 17-year-old holds a state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed.
• The 17-year-old has successfully completed a state-approved driver education course
and has no record of any moving violation at the time of hire.

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.
9
More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.

Suspension
A suspension is the temporary loss of driving privileges. When the suspension is for a specific
length of time, a driver may regain driving privileges after the suspension has ended
and a reinstatement fee has been paid. In some cases, the driver’s license will not be returned
until other requirements are met.
Offenses for which a driver’s license may be suspended include, but are not limited to:
• Automated Traffic Violations — Failure to pay five or more unpaid automated traffic

Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.
— Chapter 8 Study Questions —
1. An individual’s driving privileges may be suspended under which of the following conditions?
a. Three reckless driving offenses in 12 months.
b. Drag or street racing.
c. Illegally transporting alcohol twice in 12 months by a person over age 21.
2. Driving privileges may be revoked for giving false information to the Secretary of State.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

Downgrade
This sign warns a driver of a dangerous hill. It may be very long or
steep, or it may have sharp curves. Drivers should slow their speed
before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

CONSTRUCTION
72
Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other
plate categories carry additional fees in addition to the following fees:
Passenger vehicle and B-truck (8,000 pounds or less) ....................................................$101
Motorcycle .........................................................................................................................$41
Autocycle ...........................................................................................................................$71
Replacement plate (1)..........................................................................................................$6
Replacement plates (2) ........................................................................................................$9
Replacement sticker ..........................................................................................................$20
Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.

but ONLY if all the following requirements are met:
• The driving is limited to daylight hours.
• The 17-year-old holds a state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed.
• The 17-year-old has successfully completed a state-approved driver education course

that the youth may spend no more than one-third of the work time in any workday and no
more than 20 percent of the work time in any work week driving.
The driving may not involve:
• Towing vehicles;
• Route deliveries or route sales;
• Transportation for hire of property, goods or passengers;
• Urgent, time-sensitive deliveries (such as pizza deliveries);
• Transporting more than three passengers, including employees of the employer;
• Driving beyond a 30-mile radius from the youth’s place of employment;
• More than two trips away from the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver
the employer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries, which
are prohibited); or
• More than two trips away from the primary place of employment in any single day to
transport passengers, other than employees of the employer.
The State of Illinois has laws that further limit driving for hire. For more information, contact
the nearest Wage and Hour District Office, or visit www.dol.gov.

The Secretary of State’s Emergency Contact Database allows Illinois driver’s license
and ID cardholders to enter emergency contact information for free into a voluntary,
secure database. In the event of a motor vehicle crash or other emergency situation
when a person is unable to communicate directly, law enforcement can access the
database to help reach the person’s designated contacts. To register your emergency

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

This edition of the Illinois Rules of the Road is as accurate as possible at the time of publication. The
booklet contains information you must know to pass the written test on traffic laws and signs in order
to obtain basic driving privileges. It includes information on obtaining a driver’s license, driver’s license
laws, traffic safety issues and general information regarding Illinois traffic laws and ordinances.
The language of the Illinois Compiled Statutes is condensed and paraphrased and does not cover every
law or explain every possible situation that motorists may face while operating a motor vehicle. The
manual also provides highway safety information not in the law. It is intended as a tool for drivers and
should not be cited as a legal authority in court. Additional information and forms are available at

Driver’s License Classifications
Driver’s licenses are classified by the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the operator’s
vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.
9
More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.

School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

35
location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.
The Secretary of State will immediately revoke the driving privileges of anyone who is convicted
of a moving violation that caused a crash and resulted in the death of another person.
Other offenses for which a driver’s license may be revoked include, but are not limited to:

Driving while a driver’s license is suspended or revoked will result in an extension of the
suspension or revocation period and may subject the driver to a period of incarceration.
More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP

65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
driver that a median separates both directions of traffic on the road
the driver is going to turn onto or cross.
Keep Right
This sign tells a driver where to drive when approaching traffic islands,
medians or other obstructions in the middle of the roadway.
A driver must drive to the side indicated by the arrow.
Slower Traffic Keep Right
This sign is posted for those driving slower than the normal speed
of traffic on some multilane highways. It tells the slow driver to drive
in the right lane.
ONLY
67
Stop Here on Red
This sign is used when it is not clear where vehicles must stop at an
intersection with traffic signals.
Do Not Pass
This sign informs a driver to not pass other vehicles.
It is posted on some two-lane roads where
traffic goes in both directions. There will also be
yellow “no passing” lines on the road.
Pass with Care
This sign informs drivers that they have reached
the end of the no-passing zone. The driver may
pass now only when it is safe.
Road Closed
This sign is used when the road is closed to all traffic. A driver may
not continue on the road.
Bike Lane
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane for bicyclists. These lanes
are marked by a solid white line that becomes a dotted line ending
before it reaches the corner. Bicycle lanes are sometimes painted a
bright green color in order to increase visibility.
Warning Signs
Warning signs alert a driver to conditions ahead. These signs are usually
diamond-shaped and warn about road hazards, construction sites,
schools or other situations that require special attention. While most
warning signs are yellow, some communities may use fluorescent yellow-
green pedestrian, bicycle and school signs. Construction and
maintenance warning signs are orange.
Pedestrian Crosswalk
This sign tells a driver there is a crosswalk. Crosswalks are not always
located at intersections so a driver must watch both sides of
the street for pedestrians. Pedestrian crosswalk signs may also be
accompanied by a yellow flashing beacon located on the sign. This
beacon helps to increase driver awareness of an approaching crosswalk
and the potential presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Other Special Crossings
These signs alert a driver in advance of special areas where vehicles and pedestrians may
be crossing.
School Signs
These signs warn a driver of school areas and crossings.
A driver should stay alert and watch for children. Adult
school crossing guards, auxiliary police or police officers
often supervise these street crossings when students are
going to and from school. School safety patrol members
may assist the crossing guards. A driver should slow down
and stop when necessary.
The first two signs warn of school crossings ahead or of
school buildings or grounds next to the roadway. The last
two signs are posted at school crosswalks.
These two signs are used in areas where a reduced
speed school zone has been established. The posted
speed applies only on school days when children are
present (usual school hours are from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
but hours may vary), where a potential hazard exists because
of the children’s close proximity to traffic, or when
a light is flashing.
The use of wireless/cellphones is prohibited while driving
in a posted school speed zone.
Stop Ahead/Yield Ahead/Signal Ahead
These signs warn a driver of approaching
traffic control signals.
Although the traffic signal may not
yet be visible, the traffic signs are
close enough to require a driver to
start slowing down. Advance
warning signs also are used in
high-speed areas because of the
longer distance needed to slow
down or stop.

Turns and Curves
Certain signs are posted before turns and curves. The shape of the arrow tells a driver what
to expect. A small sign showing the maximum safe speed also may be posted below the
arrow.
Exit Ramp
These signs are posted at freeway and interstate exit ramps. This sign
shows the maximum safe speed a vehicle can be driven on the ramp.
Slippery Pavement
All roads are slippery and dangerous when wet. This sign warns of
conditions that can cause a driver to lose control of a car. A driver
should slow down when coming upon wet pavement because it takes
longer to stop.

before starting down the hill.
Narrow Bridge
This sign warns a driver that an approaching bridge has a narrow
roadway. A bridge width is generally 2 feet less than the width of
the approach pavement.
Reduction in Lanes
These signs are used on multi-lane highways to warn a driver of a reduction in the number
of traffic lanes in the direction of travel. Drivers should be prepared to change lanes or to
allow other vehicles to merge into their lane. Drivers of all vehicles may need to adjust
their speed and position to avoid a crash with another vehicle.
Road Narrows
This sign warns a driver that a two-lane road suddenly narrows.
No Passing
This sign is used on two-lane, two-way roads. It warns a driver not
to pass. The sign is posted on the left side of the road at the beginning
of a no passing zone.
Merging Lanes
This sign tells a driver that two lanes of traffic going the same direction
will soon merge into one lane. Drivers should be ready to either
change lanes or allow other traffic to merge into their lane.
Merge signs may appear on expressways just before expressway
ramps. The driver on the expressway should slow down to let the
driver on the ramp merge.
71
Change in Direction
This sign warns a driver of a change in direction or narrowing of the
road. A driver may find several of these signs on the outside of a
sharp curve or on approaches to a narrow bridge.
Divided Highway
Divided highways have a center strip that separates traffic going in opposite directions.
The first sign is posted before a divided highway begins.
The second sign is posted just before the divided highway ends. A driver should be careful
nearing the end of a divided highway.
Two-Way Roadway
This sign informs drivers that they are leaving a divided roadway and
approaching a two-way highway.
Construction and Maintenance Signs
Construction and maintenance zone signs alert a driver to changing conditions on the roadway
and help keep highway workers safe.
Workers Ahead
These signs are posted far enough ahead to give a driver time to adjust vehicle speed for
any unusual conditions. When a driver sees these signs, workers may be working close to
the traffic lane. Drivers should follow the signs and adjust vehicle speed to the posted construction
zone speed limit, stay alert and keep a safe distance between their vehicle and
all traffic barriers.

CONSTRUCTION
72
Warning Cones, Drums and Barricades
These devices are used to protect a driver from dangerous locations by marking a path for
the vehicle to follow in construction and maintenance zones. They also are used to warn
motorists of an existing hazard.
Warning Lights and Arrow Boards
Warning lights help draw a driver’s attention to drums and barricades
at night. Arrow boards warn the motorist of an upcoming lane closure,
or caution when construction is ahead and the direction to
merge or move.
Flagger
This sign warns there is a flagger ahead. A driver should use caution
when approaching a flagger as the individual will be working close
to traffic. A driver should slow down and be prepared to obey the
signals of the flagger. A driver must stop if signaled to do so.
Other Special Signs
Slow-Moving Vehicle
A vehicle displaying this sign is moving slowly. A driver must slow
down and may pass only when safe and legal to do so.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Parking spaces with this sign are reserved for vehicles displaying
Persons with Disabilities license plates, Disabled Veteran license
plates and/or disabled parking placards.
Guide Signs
Guide signs give drivers information about their location, the road being traveled on and
how to get to a specific location. Most guide signs are rectangular; however, guide signs
for county roads and route markers on freeways are different in shape. The type of information
given determines the color of the sign.

Chapter 10: Traffic Signals
and Pavement Markings
Traffic signals and pavement markings must be obeyed unless a police or traffic control officer
directs otherwise. A driver may never leave the roadway to avoid a traffic signal.
Traffic Signals
Traffic lights at intersections usually have three colors — red, yellow and green — from
top to bottom or from left to right. At some intersections, however, there may be a single
red, yellow or green light. Some traffic lights are steady, some flash and some are arrows.
When traffic control signals are not working, a driver must always treat the intersection as
an all-way stop, by coming to a complete stop, unless directed otherwise by law enforcement.
The driver must then look and yield the right of way before entering an intersection.
Steady Lights
Red Light — The driver must stop at the marked stop line. If there is not a
marked stop line, the driver must stop before entering the crosswalk. If there
is no crosswalk, the driver must stop before entering the intersection. Vehicles
are not allowed to go until the light is green and the intersection is clear. A
driver may make a right turn at a red light unless there is a sign prohibiting it.
A driver also may make a left turn at a red light when turning from a one-way
street onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both
instances, a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to
oncoming traffic and pedestrians before turning.
Yellow Light — The yellow light warns that the signal is changing from green
to red. When the red light appears, a driver may not enter the intersection.
Green Light — A driver may go after yielding the right of way to any pedestrians
and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Flashing Lights
Flashing Red — A driver must stop, yield the right of way to traffic within
the intersection or crosswalk and proceed when safe. This light is used at intersections
when a stop sign alone is hard to see or where additional emphasis
on the stop sign is needed. It also is used at railroad crossings to warn of approaching
trains.
Flashing Yellow — A driver should proceed into the intersection with caution.
75
Arrows
After yielding the right of way to traffic within the intersection or crosswalk, a
driver may go in the direction the arrow is pointing.
Red Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit red arrow means a driver
cannot make the movement shown by the arrow until a green arrow appears.
There are two exceptions. A driver may make a right turn at a red arrow. A driver
also may make a left turn at a red arrow when turning from a one-way street
onto another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. In both instances,
a driver must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians before proceeding.
Yellow Arrow (constantly lit) — The constantly lit yellow arrow means the
green arrow is ending or that the light is about to turn red.
Yellow Arrow (flashing) — The flashing yellow arrow means a driver may
turn in the direction the arrow is pointed after yielding the right of way to any
pedestrians and vehicles in the intersection or crosswalk.
Green Arrow — When the arrow is pointed upward, a driver may go straight
ahead only. When the arrow is pointed to the right, a driver may turn to the
right. When the arrow is pointed to the left, a driver may turn to the left.
Pedestrian Traffic Signals, Walk Lights and Crossings
Pedestrians must yield the right of way to drivers by obeying traffic signals, observing
walk lights and using crosswalks.
• Walk (walking person) — Pedestrians facing the signal may cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal.
• Don’t Walk (flashing orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not start
entering the roadway. A pedestrian who has partially completed crossing during
the constantly lighted walk signal may continue to a sidewalk or safety
island.
• Don’t Walk (constantly lit orange upraised hand) — Pedestrians may
not enter the roadway.
• Yellow Light (constant upraised hand) — Pedestrians may not cross unless
directed by a pedestrian control sign or police officer.
Lane Signals
Special lights sometimes are used over each lane on highways and expressways.
They are used most often to change the flow of traffic during certain hours
of the day.
Red “X” — A driver must never drive in this lane when the red ”X” is displayed.
Yellow “X” — This indicates the lane signal is going to change to red. A driver
should leave this lane safely before the red “X” appears.
Flashing Yellow “Arrow” — This indicates the lane may be used for approaching
and making a left turn.
Green Arrow — This indicates lanes may be used, but all other signs and signals
must be obeyed.

Pavement Markings
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road tell a driver where the edge of the pavement is located.
Solid white lines are used on the right of the roadway edge. Solid yellow lines are used on
the left edge of divided streets or roadways.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.
• Broken white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. A driver
may only cross the line when changing lanes or turning.
• Solid white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing a
solid white line requires special care and is discouraged.
• Solid double white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Crossing
a double solid white line is prohibited.
Yellow Center Lines
Yellow center lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.
• Broken yellow lines separate single lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. A
driver is allowed to pass.
• Solid double yellow lines are used where traffic is moving in opposite directions. Two
solid lines mark the center of the roadway and may be crossed to make a left turn to or
from an alley, private road, driveway or street.
Yellow No Passing Lines
No passing lines are solid yellow lines on roads where
traffic moves in opposite directions. The lines indicate
zones where passing is not allowed.
When the solid yellow line is on the driver’s side of the
center line, the driver may cross it to finish the passing
maneuver already started before the beginning of the
no passing zone. A driver may cross it to make a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
77
When there is a solid and a broken yellow line separating
two lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions,
a driver may pass only when the broken yellow
line is nearest the driver’s lane.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Two-way left turn lanes are marked with yellow lines and white arrows. A left turn may
not be made from any other lane when a turn lane is provided. A vehicle may not be driven
in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or
when preparing for or making a U-turn when permitted by law.
White Stop Line
A white stop line is painted across a lane at an intersection. The line is usually 4 feet before
the crosswalk in an urban area. It shows where a driver must stop the vehicle for a stop
sign or red light. A driver must stop the vehicle before any part of it crosses the line.
White Crosswalk Lines
White crosswalk lines are painted across the entire width of the pavement. Sometimes the
inside area is marked with white diagonal lines for added visibility. Pedestrians in crosswalks
have the right of way over vehicles. Crosswalks are sometimes in the middle of the
block and a pedestrian crossing sign is located at the white lines.
Other Markings
• Yellow or white diagonal stripes are used to mark fixed obstructions.
• Solid white or yellow lines are sometimes used to channel traffic around a hazard.
• Curb markings, fire lanes and pavement markings may be designated as “No Parking”
areas by local authorities.
78
Railroad Crossings
Railroad crossings are marked with one or more of the following special warning devices:
• Round Advance Warning Sign — A yellow sign with a black “X” and the letters “RR”
means a highway-railway crossing is ahead. The sign may be placed up to 750 feet in
advance of the railroad crossing.
• Pavement Markings — A solid yellow line in advance of the crossing means no passing.
White stop lines on each side of the track show motorists where to stop when a
train is approaching. These markings also indicate a highway-railway crossing is ahead.
•Railroad Crossbuck Sign — If a railroad crossing has more than one track, the number
of tracks is on the sign below the crossbuck. This is considered a yield sign and a driver
must yield the right of way to any oncoming trains and railroad equipment.
• Flashing Light Signals — When lights begin to flash, a driver must always stop until
the train has passed and the lights have stopped flashing.
• Gates — A driver must remain stopped until the lowered gates are raised and lights are
no longer flashing. Drivers should not attempt to beat crossing gates as they are lowering
or go around lowered gates.
Tracks equipped with an automated railroad crossing enforcement system may record an
image of the vehicle license plate number, time, date and location of any violation. Drivers
are subject to fines and possible suspension of their driving privileges for violations.

Chapter 11: Safe Driving Tips
Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. A driver must obey all traffic laws and be prepared
to react to other drivers and driving conditions.
Drive Defensively
A driver should always be prepared to react to another driver. A driver should not assume
to know what the other driver is going to do. If unable to avoid a crash, a driver should remain
calm and try to choose the least dangerous situation.
Following Distances
Following a vehicle too closely, or tailgating, is the cause of most rear-end crashes. A driver
should use the three-second rule to determine a safe following distance. To use the threesecond
rule, a driver should select a fixed object on the road ahead such as a sign, tree or
overpass. When the vehicle in front passes the object, a driver should count “one-thousandone,
one-thousand-two, etc.” The driver’s vehicle should not reach the object before the
count of one-thousand-three. If this occurs, the driver is following too close.
The three-second rule also applies to vehicle speed when on a good road and during good
weather conditions. If the road and/or weather conditions are not good, a driver should increase
the following distance even more. A driver being tailgated should move to another
lane or slowly pull off the road and allow the vehicle to pass.

Vehicle Speed
Driving too fast or too slowly can create a dangerous situation. Regardless of the posted
speed limit, weather and traffic conditions may make it necessary to drive more slowly. A
driver should adjust a vehicle’s speed for the conditions and to match the flow of traffic, as
long as it does not surpass the maximum posted speed limit. Doubling a vehicle’s speed
quadruples the vehicle’s stopping distance.
Drivers should consider the following when deciding vehicle speed:
• How quickly they can react physically and mentally.
• Type and condition of the roadway.
• The size of the tires — large, wide tires with good tread will stop a vehicle faster than
small, narrow tires with little tread.
• The condition of the brakes — newer brakes stop a vehicle more quickly than older, worn
brakes.
• The direction of the wind and how fast is it blowing — a strong tail wind can make it
very difficult to stop.
• The type of vehicle — vehicle design, weight distribution, suspension and shock absorbers
all play a role in how quickly a vehicle can stop.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can impair the ability to drive safely, even if the driver does not fall asleep.
A driver often cannot react in time to apply brakes or steer away from a potential crash. A
driver should be properly rested and avoid drowsiness by stopping frequently when taking
long trips. Exercising the eyes by reading road signs or shifting the focus to different parts
of the roadway is also helpful.
Weather Conditions
Weather can create a driving hazard. Special care must be taken in fog, rain, high winds
and winter driving conditions.
Fog
While it is not advisable, if operating a car in foggy conditions, a driver should take the following
precautions:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Slow down. If a driver sees headlights or taillights, the vehicle should slow down even
more. A driver may be driving in the center of the roadway or may be stopped or barely
moving.
• Drive with the headlights set on dim or use fog lights.
• Do not overdrive the headlights. A driver should stay within the limits of vision in case it
is necessary to stop suddenly. If the fog is too dense, a driver should pull off the roadway
and stop. Vehicles should not drive at 5-10 mph.
82
• Use turn signals long before making a turn.
• Brake early when approaching a stop to warn other drivers.
Rain
Illinois law requires a driver to use the vehicle’s headlights when operating the windshield
wipers. When rain begins to fall lightly, water, dust, oil and leaves cause the roadway to
become slippery. A driver should take the following precautions when driving in rain:
• Turn off the cruise control and increase the following distance.
• Take special precautions on curves, turns and while braking.
• Slow down to avoid hydroplaning. If a vehicle skids while hydroplaning, the driver should
try to regain control of the vehicle. If that is not possible, the driver should release the
accelerator and ride out the skid.
If a driver comes across a roadway or viaduct that has been flooded due to heavy rain, it is
not advised to drive through the flooded area. It is not possible for a driver to determine the
depth or current of the water. The driver should turn the vehicle around and find another route.
High Winds
Wind can be a difficult problem, especially for drivers of trucks, recreational vehicles,
campers and trailers-in-tow. A driver should take the following precautions:
• Reduce speed and make steering corrections when going from a protected area to an
open area and when meeting large vehicles such as trucks and buses.
• Heavy rain or sleet often accompanies high winds. Be alert to wet or slippery areas and
plan for those conditions.
• The Illinois Tollway System bans the hauling of house trailers in high winds.
Winter Driving
Winter is the most difficult driving season due to possible ice, snow, lower temperatures
and fewer daylight hours. A driver should:
• Drive slower and increase the following distance. Roadway conditions may vary depending
upon the sun, shade or roadway surface.
• Turn off the cruise control if the pavement is wet, icy or snowy.
• Remove all snow and ice from the vehicle, clear all windows and do not start driving
until the windshield is defrosted and clear. A driver should be sure to have nonfreezing
windshield washer liquid and that the vehicle’s headlights and taillights are visible.
• Be sure the vehicle is maintained properly. Lights, brakes, windshield wipers, defrosters,
radiator and other parts should be in good working order.
• Use snow tires and/or chains (where allowed). Snow tires give extra traction and chains
increase safety on snow or ice covered roads. Neither snow tires nor chains allow vehicles
to drive on bad roads at normal speeds.
• Gently apply brakes in slow, steady strokes. This helps the driver determine how much
vehicle traction is available. A driver should begin braking early when coming to an intersection
or stop.
83
• Approach bridges, shaded spots, overpasses and turns slowly. They may remain icy after
the rest of the roadway is clear and dry.
• Plan ahead for winter driving. Carrying a blanket, food and other survival equipment, such
as a shovel, in the vehicle can be helpful if stranded. If drivers do become stranded, they
should remain with the vehicle running the engine only for brief times and opening the
window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. If possible, the driver should make sure
the vehicle’s tailpipe is free of snow and debris.
Special Driving Situations and Hazards
Expressway Driving
Expressways, interstates, toll roads, turnpikes and freeways are fast, multiple-lane roads
with maximum speed limits of 55, 65 or 70 mph. A driver should be alert when driving on
expressways because speed and traffic volume are major concerns.
The following are tips for safe driving on expressways:
• When entering an expressway, a driver will usually find a speed-change lane. This lane
allows a driver to gain the speed necessary before merging. A driver should signal and
look for an opening in the traffic, match traffic speed and merge with traffic when safe.
• A driver should check the rearview and side mirrors before changing lanes.
• A driver should use turn signals when making lane changes.
• A driver should not follow too closely and allow plenty of distance between vehicles.
• The right lane is for slower traffic. The left lane is for faster traffic and for passing. A
driver should not drive continuously in the left lane.
• A driver should not stop on the expressway and should pull off the road if experiencing
a problem. A driver should lift the vehicle’s hood and turn on the vehicle’s hazard flashers.
A driver should never walk along the expressway.
• Freeway exits may be on the right or left. A driver should be sure the vehicle is in the
correct exit and speed-change lanes and use turn signals to indicate the intent to exit.
When approaching the exit, a driver should slow down to make the exit in the speedchange
lane.
84
• If an exit is missed, a driver should go to the next available exit. Backing up on an expressway
is against the law.
Night Driving
Night driving is difficult because things may appear differently than in daylight. Glare from
lights may interfere with vision. Courtesy and common sense should be used when driving
at night. A driver should:
• Never overdrive a vehicle’s headlights and always keep them clean and aimed properly.
Lights should be used from sunset to sunrise. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before
meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300 feet before passing a vehicle.
• Dim the dashboard lights, use the sun visor to avoid glare and avoid using any other light
inside the vehicle.
• Use edge lines and center lines of the roadway as guides.
• Not stop on the roadway. If a driver must stop, use of a red warning light is recommended.
Rural Intersections
Depending on the time of the year, it may be difficult to see other drivers. Some rural intersections
may be marked with warning signs (stop, yield, etc.), while others may not. When
approaching any rural intersection, a driver should slow down and look both ways before
entering the intersection.
Curves
A driver should slow down before entering a curve. A driver should not brake suddenly as
this may cause skidding or locked wheels and should never drive over the center line.
Head-on Approaches
When a vehicle is approaching a driver head-on in the same lane, a driver should immediately
slow down, pull over to the right and sound the horn.
Skidding
Skidding occurs when tires lose traction. If a driver’s vehicle starts to skid, a driver should
ease off the gas pedal or brakes, steer into the direction of the skid until regaining traction
and then straighten the vehicle.
Driving Off the Pavement
If a vehicle’s wheels drift off the pavement onto the shoulder, drivers should grip the wheel
firmly, ease their foot off the gas pedal and brake gently. After checking for traffic behind
85
the vehicle, the driver should gently steer the vehicle back onto the pavement. A driver
should not jerk the wheel to correct the steering. This may cause the vehicle to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Fire
If smoke appears, a driver should pull off the road. The engine should be turned off and the
driver should move away from the vehicle and call 9-1-1. Vehicle fires can be very dangerous.
Drivers should not fight the fire on their own.
Water Crashes
If a vehicle runs off the roadway into water but does not sink right away, the driver should
try to escape through a window. Because of differences in water pressure, a driver or passengers
may not be able to open the car doors. If the vehicle does sink, persons in the
vehicle should move to the back seat area where an air pocket usually forms. If possible,
persons trapped should take a deep breath and exit from a rear window.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Carbon monoxide is deadly. It is found in fumes produced any time a vehicle burns fuel. The
most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness,
upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. Carbon monoxide symptoms are often
described as “flu-like.” People who fall asleep in their vehicles or leave them running in
their garage can die before they have symptoms. Everyone in the vehicle is at risk, particularly
older people, infants and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or blood disorders.
It is recommended a driver or vehicle owner have a mechanic check the vehicle exhaust
system every year and never run a vehicle inside a garage that is attached to a house.
Electricity
If a driver is in a crash that results in power lines falling on the vehicle, the danger of electrical
shock exists. The driver and passengers should remain in the vehicle until help arrives.
If fire is an immediate danger, the people in the vehicle must jump clear of it. When jumping
clear, individuals should not allow any part of their body to touch the vehicle and the ground
at the same time.
Explosive Fire Hazard
A driver should always shut off a vehicle’s engine when refueling and should never smoke
around gas pumps. For safety purposes, a driver should remain with the pump while refueling.
Equipment Failure
Crashes often happen when equipment fails. Equipment failures may include:
• Blowouts — A thumping sound may be a warning of a blowout. If this happens, a driver
should ease their foot off the gas pedal and keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel,
pull safely off the roadway and check the tires. A driver should not brake suddenly.
86
• Loss of a Wheel or Tire — A driver should react the same as a tire blowout.
• Steering Failure — If drivers suddenly have no control of the steering wheel, they
should ease off the gas pedal, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and allow the
vehicle to come to a slow stop. The driver should brake very gently to prevent the vehicle
from spinning. If the vehicle has power steering or a locking steering wheel, drivers should
not turn off the ignition because the vehicle will lose either the power steering or their
ability to steer.
• Brake Failure — If the brake pedal suddenly sinks to the floor, a driver should pump it
to build pressure. If that does not work, the driver should use the emergency or parking
brake. To slow down, a driver should shift the vehicle into a lower gear.
• Headlight Failure — If the headlights fail suddenly, a driver should try using the vehicle’s
emergency flashers, parking lights and/or turn signals and pull off the road. If the
lights begin to dim, the driver should drive to a service station or pull off the road and
seek help.
• Stuck Gas Pedal — If the gas pedal becomes stuck, drivers should hook their toe under
it to free it. If it does not become free, the driver should shift the vehicle into neutral and
brake gently to slow down.
• Blocked Vision — If the driver’s vision becomes blocked, he/she should roll down the
side window to see, turn on the vehicle’s emergency flashers and pull the vehicle off the
road.
Aggressive Driving
Aggressive driving is the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely
to endanger persons or property. A driver doing any of the following may be committing
acts of aggressive driving and pose the risk of a crash:
• Speeding.
• Running red lights and stop signs.
• Tailgating.
• Passing on the shoulder of the road.
• Cutting off another vehicle.
• Slamming on brakes in front of a tailgater.
• Improper hand or facial gestures at other drivers.
• Yelling.
• Repeatedly honking the horn.
• Repeatedly flashing the headlights.
If drivers encounter an angry or aggressive motorist, they should:
• Not retaliate or in any way engage the other driver.
• Not make eye contact.
• Keep their vehicle doors locked and windows up.
• Keep enough space between themselves and the vehicle in front to pull out from behind.
• Not underestimate a driver’s potential for aggression.

Chapter 12: Equipment For Safe Driving
No matter how well individuals drive, they are not safe unless their vehicle is properly
equipped and in good working condition. It is illegal to drive a vehicle that may be a hazard
to any person or property.
Required Equipment
A motor vehicle must have the following working equipment:
• Brakes — Vehicles must have two brake systems and brakes on all wheels. The foot
brake must be strong enough to stop a vehicle traveling at a speed of 20 mph within 30
feet. The emergency or parking brake must be strong enough to stop the vehicle in 55
feet at the same speed. The emergency brake also must be able to hold the vehicle on a
grade or hill. Motor-driven cycles need only one brake.
• Headlights — Vehicles must have two headlights and they must be on from sunset to
sunrise and be used in times when rain, snow, fog or other conditions require the use of
windshield wipers. They also should be used when objects 1,000 feet away cannot be
seen. Bright lights must be dimmed 500 feet before meeting an oncoming vehicle or 300
feet before passing a vehicle. Motorcycles and mopeds require a headlight, which must
show objects 500 feet ahead, and be turned on whenever the vehicle is driven.
• Taillights — Vehicles must have two red lights visible for 500 feet from behind. Only
one taillight is needed for mopeds and motorcycles.
• Turn signals — Vehicles, except motorcycles, trailers and semitrailers, must have right

• License plate light — Vehicles must have a white light making the license plate readable
from 50 feet away and must be on when headlights are on.
• Parking lights — Front and rear parking lights are required for any vehicle stopped on
a highway at night. Some local communities may allow unlighted night parking on streets.
• Safety Belts— Passenger vehicles must have two sets of safety belts in the front seat.
Vehicles manufactured in 1965 or after may not be sold or operated in Illinois without
safety belts.
• Mirrors — One rearview mirror is required so the driver can see at least 200 feet behind
the car.
• Windows — All window glass must be approved safety glass. The windshield must be
free of snow, ice, moisture and any defects that distort vision. All glass must be free of
obstructions between the driver and front or rear windows. Tinted windows are not allowed
on the front windshield. A 6-inch strip of tinting is allowed along the entire length
at the top of the front windshield.
• Wipers — Wipers must operate properly to clear ice, snow and moisture.
• Horn — Vehicles must have a horn that can be heard from 200 feet. Sirens, whistles
and bells are allowed only on authorized emergency vehicles.
• Muffler — A muffler must be on the exhaust system to prevent excessive noise and
smoke. Cutouts, bypasses and changes to the system to increase noise are illegal.
• Bumpers — Vehicles weighing 9,000 pounds or less and all recreational vehicles must

Chapter 13: Owning a Vehicle
Purchasing a Vehicle
When an individual purchases a vehicle in Illinois, certain laws and responsibilities must
be followed.
Purchasing from a Dealer
A dealer must follow certain laws when selling a new or used vehicle. Within 20 days of
purchase, a dealer must send the following to the Secretary of State’s office:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title or Certificate of Origin.
• Separate payments for title/license plate fees and sales tax on the vehicle. Sales tax
varies depending on the city or county where the vehicle is purchased.
Purchasing from a Private Owner
If a vehicle is purchased or obtained from someone other than a dealer, within 20 days of
ownership the Secretary of State’s office must receive the following:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Properly signed Certificate of Title in the seller’s name.
• Payment of title/license plate fees.
• Payment of Vehicle Use Tax. If the selling price is less than $15,000, the tax is based on
the model year of the vehicle. If the selling price is $15,000 or more, the tax is based on
the selling price of the vehicle. A RUT-50 tax form must be submitted along with the correct
tax payment to Illinois Department of Revenue.
Purchasing Out of State
If a vehicle is purchased out of state, the following items must be sent to the Secretary of
State’s office to obtain a Certificate of Title and license plates:
• Application for Vehicle Transaction(s).
• Payment of title/license plate fees. The amount is shown on the application.
• Certificate of Origin signed by the dealer if the vehicle is new, or a properly assigned
Certificate of Title if the vehicle is used. For both new and used vehicles, the owner also
must have a Bill of Sale.
• Recent vehicle registration ID card if the owner is transferring license plates.
• Payment of sales or Vehicle Use Tax.
Vehicle Registration and Title
When a new owner registers a vehicle, he/she is providing the state with a record of that
vehicle. Registration allows the owner to legally use the vehicle on Illinois roadways. To
register a vehicle in Illinois, the owner must have an Illinois Certificate of Title. This document
proves ownership. All vehicles and mobile homes must have a Certificate of Title
whether or not they are registered.
91
Registration fees must be paid annually. A $20 late fee is assessed on registrations renewed
more than one month past the expiration date. Vanity/personalized plates and some other

Fees are subject to legislative change. For up-to-date fee information, visit
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
When the owner(s) receive the license plates/sticker, they also receive a vehicle registration
ID card that must be carried in the vehicle or with the owner when driving.
License Plate Requirements
Passenger vehicles, trucks and vans must display two plates, one on the front and one on
the rear. License plate frames should not cover any of the information on the license plates.
License plates covers are not allowed.
When a vehicle is sold, the license plates should be removed and kept by the seller. In Illinois,
license plates remain with the owner, not the vehicle.
Motorcycles, mopeds, trailers, semitrailers and buses registered under apportionment provisions
must display one license plate on the rear of the vehicle.
Truck-tractors and apportioned straight trucks must have one license plate on the front of
the vehicle.
License Plate Replacement Program
In January 2017, the Secretary of State’s office began to replace the oldest license plates
with newly designed plates. Vehicle owners with license plates manufactured in 2002-2003
will obtain a newly designed license plate when they renew their vehicle registrations in
2018. For more information about the program, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Temporary Registration Permit
When owner(s) apply for registration for their vehicle, they may be issued a Temporary Registration
Permit (TRP). This permit must be displayed in the same place and manner as a
rear license plate. The TRP is valid for 90 days from the issuance date, although it may be
reissued if the license plates do not arrive within 90 days. Once the owner(s) receive the license
plates, the TRP should be removed and replaced with the permanent license plates.
92
For the vehicle owner’s protection, the permit should be destroyed and discarded upon removal.
TRPs are available through Illinois licensed dealers, licensed remittance agencies,
currency exchanges and Secretary of State facilities.
License Plate Renewal
As a courtesy, about 60 days before a vehicle registration expires, owner(s) may receive a
reminder postcard, an email and/or renewal notice from the Secretary of State’s office. If
any vehicle information has changed, owner(s) must submit proof the registration has been
transferred to another vehicle. Owner(s) may renew online at www.cyberdriveillinois.com,
by mail, by visiting a Secretary of State facility, or by calling the toll-free number on the
postcard and/or renewal notice. Owner(s) also may renew at certain banks, (savings and
loans), currency exchanges, credit unions and remittance agencies.
Owner(s) are encouraged to immediately affix the renewal sticker to the upper right side of
the rear license plate. If the owner does not immediately display the renewal sticker and
the current sticker has expired, law enforcement may stop the vehicle and issue a ticket.
For the first 30 days following renewal, Illinois law allows motorists to drive without an
up-to-date vehicle renewal sticker displayed on their license plate provided they have a receipt
in their vehicle from the Secretary of State proving they purchased a sticker online
before expiration, but have not yet received it. The printed receipt is only valid as proof of
registration for 30 days from the expiration of the registration sticker currently displayed
on the license plate.
Registration Renewal for Veterans
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving in active duty or as a reservist, who can show
proof of service in a combat mission, shall have their standard vehicle registration fee
waived for the renewal period immediately following their return to the United States. Proof
must be shown at the time of registration renewal.
Vehicle owner(s) who are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in a non-combat capacity,
a civilian employee of the Armed Forces or an employee of the U.S. Department of
Defense serving outside the United States but are a legal resident of Illinois have 45 days
from their date of return to obtain or renew the vehicle registration.
Special License Plates
Personalized and vanity license plates are available for passenger vehicles, second division
vehicles weighing 8,000 pounds or less, motorcycles, vehicles operated by persons with
disabilities, recreational vehicles, recreational trailers and antique vehicles. Applicants
should allow at least 45 days from the time the order is placed to receive their license
plates.
93
Reduced-fee License Plates
Senior citizens and persons with disabilities who qualify for the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as Circuit Breaker) tax relief through the Illinois Department on Aging are eligible
for reduced license plate fees for passenger (standard license plates and specialty license
plates) and recreational vehicles. One discount per year is allowed. For more information,
please call the Illinois Department on Aging at 800-252-8966 or 888-206-1327 (TTY).
Mandatory Insurance
All vehicles operated in Illinois must be covered by liability insurance, which covers injuries
or damages to other persons or their property caused by a vehicle crash. Vehicle owner(s)
are required to provide insurance information at the time of registration renewal. Once the
vehicle owner(s) signs the registration or renewal application, they affirm that the vehicle
is properly insured. Some vehicle classes are required to carry higher liability coverage
under other laws. The following are minimum liability insurance limits in Illinois:
• $25,000 for injury or death of one person in a crash.
• $50,000 for injury or death of more than one person in a crash.
• $20,000 for damage to property of another person.
Evidence of liability coverage must be carried by the motorist or in the vehicle and shown
to law enforcement officers upon request. Insurance companies must issue Illinois insurance
cards to policyholders or provide an insurance card that can be displayed on the driver’s
cellphone or other electronic device. Vehicle owner(s) should contact their insurance agent
or company if they lose their insurance card or the company fails to send one. Vehicle owners(
s) should carry some other form to prove insurance coverage, such as an insurance
binder, the current policy declarations page, a certificate of insurance or the last insurance
payment receipt, until they receive their new card.
Enforcement of the law is managed through random computer checks by the Secretary of
State’s office and the issuance of traffic tickets. In addition, vehicle owner(s) must provide
proof of insurance to the Secretary of State’s office or the remitter when renewing their license
plates. This proof of insurance can be in a paper or electronic format. Failure to carry
the required insurance will result in fines, the inability to renew the vehicle registration,
suspension of driving privileges and suspension of the vehicle registration until proof of insurance
is obtained. Providing false information to the Secretary of State’s office or a remitter
for the purpose of renewing the vehicle registration may result in criminal charges
and a fine. Vehicle owner(s) who have trouble obtaining insurance should contact the Illinois
Automobile Insurance Plan for assistance.
Emissions Testing
In compliance with the Clean Air Act, certain vehicles in various areas of Illinois must pass
an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) emissions test in order for the Secretary
of State’s office to renew the vehicle’s registration. The IEPA is required by law to notify
94
owner(s) of the scheduled test month and year for their vehicle. A vehicle emissions test is
required in the following counties: all of Cook, DuPage and Lake, and parts of Kane, Kendall,
McHenry, Will, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Vehicle owner(s) who move from the area
in which testing is required must notify the IEPA. For more information, please call the IEPA:
Chicago Metro area, 847-758-3400; East St. Louis Metro area, 800-635-2380.
License Plates and Parking Placards
for Persons with Disabilities
License Plates
Individuals with a permanent disability may obtain Persons with Disabilities License Plates
for vehicles titled in their name. An immediate family member residing in the same household
may obtain two sets of plates if the qualifying person with disabilities does not own a vehicle
and must rely on someone else for transportation. Corporations, school districts, limited liability
companies, nursing homes, convalescent homes and special education cooperatives
transporting eligible persons may obtain these plates as well. These plates DO NOT exempt
the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at parking meters.
Parking Placards
Disability parking placards may be used in any vehicle in which the authorized holder is driving
or is a passenger. The four types of disability parking placards are:
• Meter-Exempt Permanent —This placard is issued to persons with permanent disabilities
that significantly impairs their ability to access a parking meter. There are specific
types of disabilities that meet this qualification. The placard allows the authorized holder
to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities, such as a mall, grocery or retail
store, and exempts the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations at meters
exceeding a 30-minute time limit. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s birth
month in 2022.
• Permanent — This placard is issued to persons with other types of permanent disabilities.
The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved for persons with disabilities
such as a mall, grocery or retail store. The placard DOES NOT exempt the holder
from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire on the last day of the holder’s
birth month in 2022.
• Temporary — This placard is issued to persons with a temporary disability. The placard
is valid for the length of time indicated by the certifying physician, not to exceed six months
if issued by the Secretary of State and 90 days if issued by a local municipality. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the authorized holder from parking meter fees and time limitations.
• Organization — This placard is issued to organizations that offer free transportation to
persons with disabilities. The placard allows the authorized holder to park in spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities when transporting persons with disabilities. The placard
DOES NOT exempt the holder from parking meter fees and time limitations. Placards expire
on April 30, 2022. For more information on any of the items discussed in this chapter, visit

Illinois continues to be a national leader in
traffic safety. Over the last decade, traffic
fatalities in our state have declined
significantly. This is due in large part to
innovative efforts to combat drunk and
distracted driving, as well as stronger
guidelines for new teen drivers. The driving
public’s increased awareness and avoidance of hazardous driving
behaviors are critical for Illinois to see a further decline in traffic
fatalities.
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes, as well
as preventing identify theft, my office has changed the issuance
process for Illinois driver’s licenses and identification cards (DL/ID).
Applicants visiting Driver Services facilities now receive a temporary,
secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and is good for
driving and/or identification purposes. In addition, the facility employee
will give the old DL/ID back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
The applicant’s information is sent to a centralized, secure facility in
Illinois. After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the
applicant’s identity, a higher quality, more secure DL/ID is printed and
sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s address.
The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important
features that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
Last year, my office launched a license plate replacement program
designed to replace old license plates with a newly designed plate at
no additional cost to Illinois taxpayers. More than 1.5 million license
plates have already been replaced.
As Secretary of State, I will continue to maintain the highest standards
when it comes to traffic safety and public service in Illinois.

Printed by authority of the State of Illinois. March 2018 - 700M - DSD A 112.29
In an effort to meet federal standards for boarding airplanes as well as preventing identity
theft, the Secretary of State’s office has made security feature upgrades to Illinois driver’s
licenses and identification cards (DL/ID) and changed the issuance process for all applicants.
This means that Illinoisans who come in to renew or apply for a DL/ID will receive a temporary,
secure paper document upon leaving the facility, which is valid for 90 days.
The temporary, secure paper DL/ID will contain a photo and the basic information that appears
on the permanent DL/ID. In addition, the facility employee will give the old DL/ID
card back to the applicant after punching a hole in it.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s information will be sent to a centralized, secure facility in Illinois.
After fraud checks have been conducted to ensure the applicant’s identity, a higher quality,
more secure DL/ID will be printed and sent via U.S. mail within 15 business days to the applicant’s
address. The design of the DL/ID card has been upgraded with important features
that over-the-counter technology simply cannot produce.
These necessary changes are important steps toward becoming REAL ID compliant, which
is a federal mandate by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, central issuance
provides better fraud and identity theft prevention by allowing the office time to investigate
before applicants receive their DL/ID. If misconduct is detected, the office can
prevent the permanent card from being mailed.
Applicants who do not receive their new permanent DL/ID after 15 business days can check
the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call 217-782-7044.

vehicle. A driver seeking a basic license to operate a car in Illinois is issued a Class D license.
The following is a list of all classifications in Illinois:
• Class A — Any combination of motor vehicles with a gross combined weight rating
(GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, providing that the vehicle being towed is in excess of
10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally
required.)
• Class B — Any single motor vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more or any such
vehicle towing another not in excess of 10,000 pounds. This does not include motorcycles
or motor-driven cycles. (A CDL is generally required.)
8
• Class C — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of more than 16,000 pounds but less than
26,001 pounds, or any vehicle towing another with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less or
any vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver, or hazardous
materials that require placarding. This does not include motorcycles or motor-driven cycles.
• Class D — Any motor vehicle with a GVWR of 16,000 pounds or less, except those vehicles
requiring a Class A, B or C driver’s license or an L or M motorcycle license.
• Class L — Any motor-driven cycle with less than 150cc displacement.
• Class M — Any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.
Holders of a Class D license may operate rental vehicles up to 26,000 pounds when transporting
their own personal property or that of an immediate family member for non-business
purposes within the State of Illinois. The driver is required and should be provided information
to successfully complete a safety course regarding the safe operation of that vehicle
from the rental company.
Certain licenses can be issued under special circumstances. These are:
• Probationary License — Issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that
grants full-driving privileges during a period of suspension for a driver age 21 and over.
The license may only be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a
12-month period and cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Restricted Local Driver’s License — Issued to a driver who lives in a community with
less than 3,500 residents and drives only within certain areas of the community.
Driver’s License Renewal
About 90 days before the license expires, an Illinois driver should receive a renewal notice
from the Secretary of State’s office with information on what documents must be provided
and what tests are necessary. The driver may renew the license up to one year before a
two- or four-year driver’s license expires. A driver may renew up to six months before a
one-year driver’s license expires.
Drivers may not receive a renewal notice if they fail to notify the Secretary of State’s office
of a change of name or address. It is the driver’s responsibility to renew the license
before expiration, regardless of whether a renewal letter is received. A driver
holding a temporary visitor driver’s license will not receive a renewal notice.
A driver’s license is valid for four years and expires on the driver’s birthday except in the
following cases:
• Drivers under age 21 — license expires three months after their 21st birthday.
• Drivers ages 81-86 — license valid for two years.
• Drivers ages 87 and older — license requires annual renewal.
• Drivers holding a temporary visitor driver’s license — expires in three years or upon the
expiration of immigration documents.

More information on renewing a CDL or motorcycle license is available by checking the Illinois
Motorcycle Operator Manual, the Rules of the Road for Non-CDL Vehicles or the Commercial
Driver’s License Study Guide.
More information on renewing and a list of acceptable documents for a temporary visitor
driver’s license is available by referring to the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License Quick Guide
or visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Standard Renewal
To renew a driver’s license, applicants must:
• Visit a Driver Services facility and present their renewal notice.
• Take the appropriate exam(s), if applicable.
• Pay the appropriate fee and have a new photo taken.
Upon payment and successful completion of any required testing, the Secretary of State
will issue a temporary, secure paper document, which is valid for 90 days and should be
used as the document for driving purposes and proof of identification.
Following fraud checks, a permanent driver’s license or ID card will be printed at a centralized
location and mailed to the applicant, usually within 15 business days, to the address
provided by the applicant at the Driver Services facility. Driver’s license and/or ID cards will
not be delivered by the post office if there is a forwarding order or any type of hold on mail
service for the address provided by the applicant.
If applicants do not receive the permanent driver’s license or identification card after 15 business
days of visiting a facility, they can check the status at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or call
217-782-7044.
Safe Driver Renewal
The Safe Driver Renewal Program enables certain drivers with a clean driving record to
renew their driver’s licenses from home and visit a Driver Services facility only once every
eight years. An eligible driver will receive a notice in the mail detailing how to complete
the renewal process online, by phone or by mail. To be eligible for Safe Driver Renewal, a
driver must:
• Be ages 22-74;
• Not hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) or school bus driver permit;
• Not hold a temporary visitor driver’s license (TVDL);
• Have no traffic infractions, sanctions, crash reports or medical report review requirements;
and
• Have Social Security information verified through the Social Security Online Verification
System.
More information on the Safe Driver Renewal program is available by visiting
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
10
Penalties for Driver’s License/ID Card Fraud
Persons committing the following offenses are subject to arrest, possible imprisonment of
up to five years and a 12-month suspension or revocation of their driving privileges:
• Signing a driver’s license/ID card application that includes false information.
• Presenting false identification for the purposes of obtaining a driver’s license/ID card.
• Using a fictitious or unlawfully altered driver’s license/permit.
• Presenting another person’s driver’s license/ID card as their own.
• Allowing another person to knowingly use identification documents to apply for a driver’s
license/ID card using their name.
Medical Report
When applying for a driver’s license, applicants will be asked about any physical or mental
conditions that may potentially impair their safe operation of a motor vehicle or any medications
(prescribed or over-the-counter), drugs or alcohol that may impair their driving
ability. In certain instances, applicants must provide a Medical Report completed by a licensed
physician verifying their medical ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The
report must be presented to the Driver Services facility personnel within 90 days from the
date the physician signs it. The form is available at any Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
If drivers develop a medical condition that is likely to cause a loss of consciousness or any
loss of ability to operate a vehicle safely, they must notify the Secretary of State’s office
within 10 days of becoming aware of the condition. Failure to do so may lead to cancellation
of the driver’s license and driving privileges.
Driving Records/Abstracts
The Secretary of State keeps records of the traffic violations and crashes accumulated by
a driver while a resident of Illinois. If Illinois drivers are convicted of a traffic violation while
driving in another state, the offense will be included on the record as though it happened
in Illinois. If drivers are not a resident of this state and convicted of a traffic violation in Illinois
where immediate action is required, a record will be established for them in Illinois,
and the traffic violation also will be reported to their home state.
Illinois drivers may purchase a copy of their driving record at select Driver Services facilities.
To locate a facility, a driver may visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com, and click on Facility Finder.
Driving records/abstracts also may be obtained by submitting a written request to: Secretary
of State, Abstract Unit, 2701 S. Dirksen Pkwy., Springfield, IL 62723. The request must include
the driver’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number, along with the appropriate
fee. The person requesting the driving record must provide proper identification.
Driving abstracts may not be purchased online.
11
Non-Driving Programs
Related to the Driver’s License
The Secretary of State’s office is required to ask certain non-driving-related questions during
the driver’s license/ID card application process. Among these are:
• Illinois Organ/Tissue Donor Registry – Applicants age 16 and older will be asked to
join the registry. More information on the Organ Donor Program is available by visiting
www.LifeGoesOn.com or calling 800-210-2106.
• Veteran Designation – A “VETERAN” designation may be placed on the face of an
Illinois driver’s license/ID card at the request of the card applicant. The applicant must
have received an honorable discharge from any branch of the U.S. military or serve as
a reservist or member of the National Guard and must have a certificate of military service
or a DD-214 certified (Blue Seal) by the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com or calling the Illinois Department
of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-437-9824.
• Voter Registration – Any person applying for a driver’s license/ID card will be asked if
he/she would like to apply to register to vote. The application will be transmitted to the
appropriate election authority for processing. The local election authority will then mail a
voter registration card to the applicant. For more information, individuals should contact
their local election authority. This does not apply to temporary visitor driver’s license applicants.
• Selective Service – Federal law requires all males ages 18-25 to register with the Selective
Service System. The signature on the driver’s license/ID card application of any
qualifying male certifies that he has registered or, if not already registered, authorizes
the Secretary of State’s office to submit his information to the Selective Service System
for registration.

Chapter 2: Driver’s License Exams
When applying for a driver’s license, individuals may be required to complete a vision
screening, as well as written and driving exams. Vision screening and a written test are required
for the issuance or renewal of all permits. Applicants must also pay the appropriate
fee. (See pages 11-12.) Applicants are allowed three attempts to pass each of these exams
within one year from the date the application fee is paid.
Vision Screening
All driver’s license applicants must have a vision screening or submit a Vision Specialist
Report completed by a licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist or physician dated within six
months of a facility visit. This form is available at any local Driver Services facility or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Vision requirements include:
• Minimum visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. A driver with acuity
between 20/41 and 20/70 is limited to daylight driving only.
• At least 140 degree peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side) with or without corrective
lenses.
Applicants wearing glasses or contact lenses will have a restriction noted on the license
requiring they wear glasses or contact lenses when operating a vehicle. Applicants wearing
telescopic lenses must meet special requirements and undergo additional vision testing to
receive a license.
Written Exam
Every driver must take a written exam every eight years, except a driver having no traffic
convictions. The basic written exam requires driver’s license applicants to:
• Identify traffic signs by shape, color or symbol.
• Identify signals and pavement markings.
• Answer multiple-choice and true-or-false questions about traffic laws, safety rules, crash
prevention and vehicle equipment.
The exam requirements for motorcycles, trucks and buses vary. Applicants should consult
the appropriate operator’s manual for these types of vehicles.
Driving Exam
New drivers are required to take a driving exam in a vehicle representing the same size
and weight classification as the driver’s license for which they are applying. A new driver
age 75 and older and any driver turning 75 or older who are renewing their driver’s license
must take a driving exam in the same classification of vehicle for the type of license for
which they are applying. (See pages 7-8 for license classifications.)
Applicants who have a traffic crash or other moving violation on their driving record may
be required to take the written and/or driving exams.
14
If the applicant is age 21 or older and driving for the first time, enrollment in a community
college or commercial driving school for adults is suggested prior to applying for a driver’s
license. More information is available by calling a local community college or commercial
driving school.
To take a driving exam, the vehicle used must:
• Be properly licensed and equipped for the driver’s license classification the applicant is
seeking.
• Comply with Secretary of State vehicle condition standards. To meet this, all the required
equipment listed in Chapter 12 of this publication must be working properly.
• Be properly insured. Proof of insurance must be provided at the time of the exam.
• Display valid front and rear Illinois license plates and a valid registration sticker. If the
vehicle is registered outside of Illinois, it must meet the registration requirements of the
respective state.
• Be driven to the facility by a driver who has a valid driver’s license/permit.
Only the examiner is allowed to be with the applicant during the driving exam. Children or
pets are not allowed in the vehicle during the exam and cannot be left unattended in the
facility while the driving exam is underway. If applicants bring children or pets, they must
bring someone to take care of them.
During the driving exam, the driver and the examiner must wear safety belts, as required
by law. Applicants will automatically fail the exam if they commit any traffic violation or
any dangerous action while taking the exam.
Applicants are graded on their ability to perform several driving tasks and maneuvers including
the following:
• Starting the vehicle by checking the vehicle controls, including the parking brake and mirrors.
The applicant must make all adjustments to seats, safety belts, mirrors and other
equipment before the vehicle is put into motion.
• Backing the vehicle approximately 50 feet at a slow speed, straight and smoothly. Applicants
should turn their head to the right and watch to the rear when performing this maneuver.
• Performing a turnabout using an alley on the left side of the street. Applicants should
turn their left signal on before turning into the alley, back the car out of the alley and
stay on their side of the street.
• Parking uphill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting uphill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Parking downhill on the side of the road. (See pages 34-35.)
• Starting downhill from a parked position. (See pages 34-35.)
• Controlling the vehicle by obeying all traffic signs, controls devices, rights of way, lane
markings and properly using turn signals.
15
Cheating and Bribery
During the written exam, applicants will be warned if they are observed doing something
that could be considered suspicious. This could be, but is not limited to, an open book within
the applicant’s field of vision, looking around or checking a cellphone or other wireless device
while taking the exam. Any applicant found cheating on any portion of the written
exam will be failed and prohibited from retaking the exam for 30 days. Taking any part of
the driver’s license exam for another person is a criminal offense punishable by
a fine and a mandatory minimum seven days in jail.
The Secretary of State’s office may deny the issuance of a driver’s license and/or instruction
permit to any person who attempts to influence any act related to the issuance of a driver’s
license or instruction permit. This includes attempting to bribe or otherwise influence an
employee of the Secretary of State’s office, the owner of a commercial driver school or any
individual authorized to give driving instructions or administer any part of a driver’s license
examination.
Special Services
The Secretary of State’s office provides the following special services for senior citizens,
persons with disabilities and veterans:
• Free Rules of the Road Review Courses.
• License plates and parking placards for persons with disabilities.
• Reduced-fee license plate renewal fees for seniors age 65 and older and persons with
disabilities who meet income criteria through the Benefit Access Program (formerly
known as the Circuit Breaker Program). For more information, individuals should contact
the Illinois Department on Aging.
• Interpreter service for the deaf or hard of hearing when obtaining or renewing a driver’s
license. Applicants needing interpreter service should make the request in advance of
their visit to the facility by calling 312-814-5683 or 888-261-5238 (TTY, NexTalk).
• Oral examinations (for the written test) can be requested in person at any Secretary of
State driver’s license facility, Monday through Thursday. The services are provided for
applicants who may have a language barrier or any type of reading or learning disability.
• Illinois driver’s license/ID cardholders may register with the Illinois Emergency Contact
Database. The program allows a person to provide emergency contact information for
law enforcement or emergency responders in the event of a crash or emergency situation.
In formation may also be provided concerning disabilities or special medical needs. More
information is available by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 3: Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, most people under age 18 learn to drive in high school or at a commercial driver
training school licensed by the Secretary of State’s office. Approved driver education classes
include at least 30 hours of classroom study and six hours of behind-the-wheel training in
a regular passenger vehicle.
Obtaining an Instruction Permit
Driver’s license applicants who are age 15-17 may receive an instruction permit with acceptable
proof from an authorized driver education provider that they are enrolled in an approved
driver education class and/or will start attending an approved driver education class
within the next 30 days. The instruction permit is valid for 24 months and must be held for
at least nine consecutive months prior to obtaining a driver’s license if the applicant is age
16 or 17. If applicants are age 17 and 3 months or older, they may apply for an instruction
permit without taking a driver education course. When applying for an instruction permit,
applicants must pass the vision and written exams for the license classification they are
seeking. The test results are valid until the expiration of the permit.
An instruction permit allows an individual to drive during the behind-the-wheel portion of
a driver education class with an adult instructor seated in the vehicle’s front passenger
seat. It also allows a person to drive with a parent, legal guardian or responsible adult who
is age 21 or older and has a valid license for the type of vehicle being driven and at least
one year of driving experience. After individuals have successfully completed the driver education
class, they may continue practice driving with an instruction permit, under the direct
supervision of a responsible adult as outlined above.
Illinois law requires drivers under age 16 to have at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel supervised
driving, including 10 hours of nighttime supervised driving, in addition to the driver
education training, before being eligible to obtain a driver’s license at age 16. A driving log
to track the supervised practice hours is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com or in the
Parent-Teen Driving Guide.
Applying for an Illinois Driver’s License
Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21 are printed vertically with distinct features. To
apply for a driver’s license before age 18, applicants must bring the following documents
to the Driver Services facility:
• Instruction permit;
• Acceptable forms of identification (see page 99);
• Affidavit/Consent For Minor To Drive (if applicable);
• Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate (if applicable); and
• 50-hour driving log with proper signature.
The Secretary of State must have received notification of the applicant’s driver education
17
completion, and the notation must appear on the driving record before a driver’s license is
issued. Students whose birthdays fall on certain dates are required to pass a driving exam
administered at a Driver Services facility even though they may have taken and passed a
road test conducted by their driver education instructor. Applicants who receive their driver’s
license prior to the expiration of the instruction permit may not be required to pay an additional
fee when applying for the driver’s license.
Driver Education and the
Cooperative Driver Testing Program
High school students who successfully complete an accredited driver education course of
classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction with a combined grade of A or B may be exempt
from taking a facility administered driving exam when applying for a driver’s license. School
districts are encouraged to participate in this voluntary program by contacting the Secretary
of State’s office. More information on the requirements for this program is available at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Upon successful completion of the classroom and behind-the-wheel portions of driver education
through a local high school, the Secretary of State’s office will receive notification
and add a notation to the individual’s driver’s license record. After successful completion
of a driving exam, the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate,
which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student’s
parent/legal guardian. The certificate, which expires on the same day as the student’s current
instruction permit and will not be extended, must be presented at any Driver Services
facility at the time of applying for the driver’s license.
Students under age 18 who drop out of high school cannot have the notation indicating
completion placed on their driver’s license record unless:
• The instructor has written verification of enrollment in a GED or alternative program;
• They have a GED;
• Prior to dropping out, they received passing grades in at least eight courses in the previous
two semesters; or
• They have written consent from their parents or legal guardian and the regional superintendent.
The local superintendent or chief school administrator may waive conditions deemed in the
best interest of the student or dropout. Successful completion of driver education may be
verified by contacting the Illinois State Board of Education at 217-782-4321.
First-Time Drivers — Age 18-20
Illinois driver’s license applicants who are age 18, 19 or 20 and have not previously been
licensed or completed an approved driver education program must complete a six-hour
Adult Driver Education Course. The Adult Driver Education Course can only be taught by
18
providers certified by the Secretary of State’s office. Courses may be taught in a classroom
setting or online, depending on the certification of a provider. Completion of an
Adult Driver Education Course from a provider not certified by the Secretary of State’s
office will not be accepted. More information on the Adult Driver Education Course is
available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Graduated Driver Licensing Program
Illinois’ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program requires drivers ages 15-20 to work their
way toward full-driving privileges. There are three progressive stages beginning at age 15
when most young drivers obtain their learner’s permit. Young drivers must earn the right to
move from one phase to the next, based on their driving behavior. Each phase of the GDL
process sets forth specific guidelines for a teen driver.
Permit Phase — Drivers Age 15
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Permit must be held for a minimum of nine months.
• Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by
a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license.
• Must not acquire any driving infractions, underage alcohol convictions or court supervisions
during the nine-month permit phase.
• Number of passengers is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts
in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
• Permit is valid for up to two years.
Initial Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 16-17
• Nighttime driving restrictions — Sun.-Thurs., 10 p.m.-6 a.m.; Fri.-Sat., 11 p.m.-6 a.m.
(local curfews may differ).
• Must maintain a conviction-free driving record for six months prior to turning 18. A traffic
conviction during the Initial Licensing Phase may extend restrictions beyond age 18.
• For the first 12 months of licensing, or until the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first, the
number of passengers is limited to one person under age 20, unless the passenger(s) is a
sibling, stepsibling, child or stepchild of the driver. After this period, the number of passengers
is limited to one in the front seat and the number of safety belts in the back seat.
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
Full Licensing Phase — Drivers Ages 18-20
• No age-related restrictions apply except in cases where a driver fails to move from the
Initial Licensing Phase to the Full Licensing Phase.
19
• Any wireless/cellphone use while driving, including a hands-free device, is prohibited
for a driver under age 19, except in the case of an emergency to contact a law enforcement
agency, health care provider or emergency services agency.
For more information about the GDL program, please refer to the Illinois Graduated Driver
Licensing Program brochure at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Brochures also are available at
any local Driver Services facility, high school driver education program or a commercial driving
school program.
Parental Responsibility
• Parental Consent — A driver age 16-17 must have the written consent of a parent/legal
guardian to obtain a driver’s license. The parent/legal guardian who gave initial consent
may cancel the minor’s license at any time, for any reason, until the driver turns 18 by
contacting the Secretary of State’s office. Driving privileges will not be reinstated until
the parent/legal guardian who withdrew consent, once again, provides consent or until
the driver turns 18, whichever occurs first. The teen driver must reapply for a driver’s license,
take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.
• Parental Access to Teen’s Driving Record — The parent/legal guardian of a person
under age 18 who holds an instruction permit or graduated driver’s license may access
the minor’s driving record at no cost at www.cyberdriveillinois.com, using a personal
identification number (PIN) provided by the Secretary of State’s office.
• Instruction Permit Completion Check — Students who are under age 21 and who
hold a valid instruction permit, as well as their parent/legal guardian, may go to the Secretary
of State’s website using the Instruction Permit number to determine if their high
school driver’s education completion/certification has been added to their driving record.
• Parent-Teen Driving Guide — In partnership with the Illinois Department of Transportation,
the Illinois High School and College Driver Education Association and the Illinois Parent
Teacher Association, the Secretary of State’s office developed a Parent-Teen Driving
Guide to assist parents in teaching their teen drivers the skills they need to know before
starting to drive on their own. The guide is available at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
• Parent-Teen Driving Contract — The Secretary of State’s office provides a voluntary
Parent-Teen Driving Contract that establishes parameters and boundaries
between parents and a teenager to enable a young driver to acquire safe driving
habits and skills. The contract is available in the Parent-Teen Driving Guide or at
www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Related Laws
• Court Supervision for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 is limited to one
court supervision for serious traffic offenses. To obtain court supervision for a traffic violation,
a driver under age 21 must attend traffic safety school. A driver under age 18
must appear in court with a parent/legal guardian and also must attend traffic safety
school. If receiving court supervision for certain alcohol-related violations, a driver under
age 18 will be denied a full graduated driver’s license for nine months.
20
• Loss of Driving Privileges for Moving Violations — A driver under age 21 who is
convicted of two or more moving violations within a 24-month period will have his/her
driver’s license suspended for a minimum of 30 days. The length of the suspension varies
according to the seriousness of the traffic offenses. A driver may be required to complete
a Driver Remedial Education Course as part of reinstatement of driving privileges. This
information will be indicated on the suspension notice. A suspended driver may be, but
is not always, eligible for a Restricted Driving Permit during the suspension period.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Alcohol Consumption — A person under age 21
who receives court supervision for possession, consumption, purchase or receipt of alcohol
will receive a three-month driver’s license suspension. A conviction will result in a
minimum six-month suspension of driving privileges.
• Driver’s License Suspension for Nighttime Driving Restriction Violation — Persons
under age 18 who violate the nighttime driving restriction during the Permit Phase
or the Initial Licensing Phase listed on page 18 may have their driving privileges suspended.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — Persons under age 18 who are charged
with an offense due to a crash where a passenger was seriously injured or killed may be
denied issuance/renewal of their driver’s license. Alcohol need not play a factor in the
crash.
• Non-Adjudicated Traffic Citation — Persons under age 18 who have been issued a
traffic citation that has not been fully adjudicated by the courts may be denied issuance
of their driver’s license.

Chapter 4: Traffic Laws
Traffic laws protect all who share Illinois’ streets and highways. It is important for a driver
to obey the orders of police officers, firefighters, highway authority officials or uniformed
adult school crossing guards who are directing traffic or performing their official duties.
Proper Action When Stopped by Law Enforcement
For the safety of vehicle operators and law enforcement officers, drivers stopped by police
should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Slow down and safely pull over on to the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is
no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, the driver should find the next safest location
and pull over.
• Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Drivers should not stop their vehicle
on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where
it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close
to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
• Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Drivers should
keep their hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs them otherwise
or the traffic stop is complete.
• Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of the
vehicle.
• Do not exit the vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived
as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer’s safety.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see a driver’s license and proof of insurance. If these
items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for
display on a cellphone, the driver should inform the police officer of that fact and then
follow the officer’s directions before retrieving the information. Vehicle operators are required
to have a valid driver’s license, registration and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle.
• If a driver cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement,
he/she should drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a
well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to
attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. A driver should activate the vehicle’s
hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
• If drivers are being stopped at night, it is acceptable for them to turn on the interior light
of the vehicle.
A traffic stop could indicate the driver has committed a minor traffic violation without realizing
it. There also may be a problem with the vehicle of which the driver is unaware or
the vehicle may be similar to one used in a serious crime. Many officers will not provide
the driver with specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained the driver’s license,
vehicle registration and insurance card from the driver.
22
If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest for the driver, he/she:
• Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
• Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature.
Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt — only an acknowledgment of
receiving the ticket.
• Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver is suspected
of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result
in the loss of driving privileges.
• Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver believes an offense
was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/she will have the opportunity to
present the case in traffic court.
• Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If a driver
believes that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter,
he/she should report the conduct as soon as possible to the officer’s superiors. Officers are
required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can
be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
Regardless of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic
stops, which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.
Distracted Driving
Illinois law prohibits the use of handheld cellphones, texting or using other electronic communications
while operating a motor vehicle. Hands-free devices or Bluetooth technology
is allowed for persons age 19 and older.
Illinois law also prohibits the use of headsets while driving. Headsets are defined as any
device, other than a hearing aid, that allows a person to hear or receive electronic communications.
The use of a single-sided headset or earpiece with a wireless/cellphone device
is permitted while driving. Motorcycle, motor-driven cycle and moped operators may use
intercom helmets which permit a driver and/or passengers to speak to one another.
Using a cellphone while holding the device and utilizing the speaker phone is not considered
hands free and is a violation of Illinois law.
Using hands-free technology such as a headset or voice activated controls is considered a
distraction while driving and can be dangerous. If a driver must make a phone call, even
with hands-free technology, it is recommended the driver pull off to the side of the
road before making the call.
The only time an Illinois driver can use a cellphone that is not hands free is:
• To report an emergency situation.
• While parked on the shoulder of a roadway.
• While stopped due to normal traffic being obstructed and the vehicle is in neutral or park.
23
A driver who is in a crash with a motor vehicle, bicyclist, pedestrian or any road
user caused by distracted driving may face criminal penalties and incarceration.
Safety Belt Law
Illinois law requires all drivers and passengers (front and back seat) age 8 and older to wear
safety belts even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. Passengers under age 8 must be
secured in an appropriate child restraint system as covered by the Child Passenger Protection
Act. (See page 24.) When riding in a truck with only a front seat equipped with safety
belts, a child under age 8 must be secured in an appropriate child restraint system.
If a passenger has a disability or medical condition that makes him/her unable to secure
his/her own safety belt, the driver is responsible for securing and adjusting the safety belt
for that passenger.
It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure ALL passengers obey the safety belt law and
the Child Passenger Protection Act. Anyone found guilty of disobeying this law is subject
to a fine and court costs.
Safety Belt Fitting
The lap belt should be worn across the hip bones and should never be positioned across
the stomach or soft part of the abdomen. The shoulder strap should be as snug as possible
yet allow the driver to reach important controls. Occupants should adjust the shoulder strap
so it is comfortable and does not cross the body at or near the neck or face.
Air Bag Safety
Air bags are designed to provide supplemental protection in combination with safety belts.
Air bags are lifesaving devices, but special precautions should be taken when driving in air
bag-equipped vehicles.
A distance of 10-12 inches between the driver and the air bag is desirable, especially for
short, elderly or pregnant drivers. A shorter driver may use foot pedal extenders. Passengers
should position their seats as far back as possible, tilting the seat back slightly if necessary.
Children riding in the front seat can be seriously injured or killed when an air bag deploys
in a crash. It is recommended that children ages 12 and younger be properly secured in the
back seat. If children under age 8 must ride in the front passenger seat with an active air
bag, they should be in a properly installed, appropriate forward-facing child safety seat
with the seat as far back as possible. Rear-facing child safety seats should be secured only
in the back seat of a vehicle and should never be installed in front of an active air bag.
24
Child Passenger Protection Act
The Child Passenger Protection Act requires all children under age 8 be properly secured in
an appropriate child safety restraint system. This includes the use of booster seats, which
must only be used with a lap/shoulder safety belt. If the back seat of the vehicle is not
equipped with lap/shoulder type safety belts, a child weighing more than 40 pounds may
be transported in the back seat without a booster seat, secured with a lap belt only. Drivers
wanting more information on child safety seat recalls issued by the U.S. government or to
have a safety seat inspected for proper installation should visit www.safercar.gov.
Speed Limits
Speeding is one of the leading contributors to vehicle crashes, deaths and serious injuries
on roadways. Individuals may drive at the maximum allowable speed only under safe conditions.
For safety purposes, a minimum speed limit may be posted along certain roadways.
When minimum limits are not posted, a driver should not drive so slow as to create an interference
with the normal movement of traffic. The following speed limits apply, unless
otherwise posted:
• Interstates and tollways — 70 mph.
• Highways with four lanes — 65 mph.
• Other highways and rural areas — 55 mph.
• City/town areas — 30 mph.
• Alleys — 15 mph.
• School zones — 20 mph (on school days between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. when children are
present and signs are posted).
Local municipalities have the discretion to post speed limits different from those listed.
A driver must take care to slow down when approaching and crossing an intersection, going
around a curve, approaching the top of a hill or traveling on a narrow and winding roadway.
A driver must be aware that there may always be dangers present due to pedestrians and
bicyclists, traffic, weather, mechanical problems or road conditions.
25
Construction Zones, Emergency Vehicles,
School Zones and Funeral Processions
Construction Zones
When approaching or entering a highway construction or maintenance area (also known
as work zones), Illinois law requires motorists to slow down, discontinue wireless/cellphone
use (unless using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset),
yield to any authorized vehicles or workers in the area, change to a lane away from the
workers when possible and proceed with caution.
Motorists must obey the posted construction zone speed limit 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, regardless of the presence of workers. Standard speed limits may be reduced due
to the presence of workers or because normal driving conditions do not exist in a construction
zone. There may be narrow lanes, drop-offs between lanes or at the edge of the pavement,
lane closures, construction equipment or obstructions near open lanes of traffic. The
speed limit may be further reduced when workers are present.
Emergency/Maintenance Vehicles
When approaching a stationary (non-moving) emergency/maintenance vehicle using visual
signals, Illinois law requires motorists to yield, change to a lane away from the emergency
workers when possible and proceed with caution. If a lane change is not possible, reduce
speed and proceed with caution. Illinois law prohibits photography and the use of
wireless/cellphones within 500 feet of an emergency scene, except in certain circumstances.
A driver is prohibited from driving over fire hoses, unless permitted by a fire official in command
of the scene.
When being approached by an emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals (lights
and/or sirens), Illinois law requires motorists to immediately pull to the right side of the
road and allow the emergency vehicle to pass. In some cases a complete stop may be necessary
to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. If stopped at an intersection with two-way
traffic, remain stopped until the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection.
School Zones
When approaching a marked school zone between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., on days when school is
in operation and children are present, a driver must discontinue wireless/cellphone use (unless
using a hands-free device that may include the use of a single-sided headset), reduce speed
to 20 mph, and stop and yield the right of way to any children or adults in the crosswalk area.
Funeral Processions
Motorists encountering a funeral procession must yield the right of way to all vehicles in
the procession. Motorists in a funeral procession should have their headlights and hazard
lights turned on. Motorists should NOT drive between vehicles in an organized funeral procession,
except when required to do so by a law enforcement officer. Vehicles are prohibited
26
from joining a funeral procession for the purpose of securing the right of way or attempting
to pass any vehicle in an organized funeral procession, except where a passing lane has
been specifically provided. Local municipalities may impound a vehicle that interferes with
a funeral procession due to reckless driving.
Right of Way
A driver must yield the right of way to other drivers, bicyclists or pedestrians:
• When making a right turn on a red light after a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at an intersection where there is a stop sign or flashing
red signal. If there is no stop line, stop before the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk or
stop line, stop at a place where all approaching traffic can be seen.
• When making a left turn on a red light after a stop from a one-way street to another oneway
street with traffic moving to the left. (See Figure A on page 27.)
• When more than one driver reaches a four-way stop intersection. The first driver to stop
should be the first to go. When two vehicles on different roadways arrive at a four-way
stop intersection at the same time, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on
the right. (See Figure B on page 27.)
• When entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
• When two vehicles on different roadways reach an uncontrolled intersection at the same
time. The vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right.
• When making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. If drivers enter an intersection while
the light is green, they may finish the turn even though the light turns red.
• When approaching a MERGE sign with through traffic. A driver must increase or decrease
speed to avoid a crash.
• When approaching a YIELD sign. A driver should slow down or stop to avoid a crash.
• Even after the light turns green when there are vehicles in the intersection.
• When emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway after coming to a complete
stop. (See Figure C on page 27.)
• To cross traffic when on the terminating highway of a “T” intersection with no traffic
control signs or signals. (See Figure D on page 27.)
• When approaching emergency vehicles using audible and visual signals.
A driver may not:
• Enter an intersection or drive within a marked crosswalk unless there is enough space
to allow passage of other vehicles and/or pedestrians.
• Drive onto a railroad crossing.
27
Pedestrian Right of Way
A driver must come to a complete stop (and yield):
• When a pedestrian is in a marked crosswalk.
• On school days, when children are in close proximity to a school zone crosswalk.
A driver must yield to a pedestrian:
• When a pedestrian is in an unmarked crosswalk on the driver’s side of the roadway and
there are no traffic control signals.
• When making a turn at any intersection.
• When making a lawful turn on a red light after coming to a complete stop.
• After coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or flashing red signal at an intersection.
• When a pedestrian enters a crosswalk before the traffic light changes.
• When a pedestrian is walking with a green light, to a walking person symbol or a walk
signal.
• When a pedestrian is leaving or entering a street or highway from an alley, building, private
road or driveway.
• When a pedestrian is entering an intersection with a flashing yellow arrow.
A driver also must yield to workers in highway construction or maintenance zones as well
as to persons with disabilities, including those with physical, hearing and visual disabilities.
“A” yields to “B” before turning
from one-way street onto
one-way street moving left.
“A” and “B” yield to “C”
because “C” arrived at
intersection first.
“A” yields to “B” because
“B” is on the right.
“B” yields to “A” at “T”
intersection with no
signs or signals.
“B” yields to “A” before
entering roadway from
alley or driveway.

28
Passing
Drivers must use caution when passing another vehicle. On a two-lane highway, the left
lane should be clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic for a distance great enough to
permit passing. Drivers should not turn back into the right-hand lane until the entire vehicle
they have just passed is visible in the rearview mirror. Drivers must return to their lane before
getting within 200 feet of an oncoming vehicle. The driver of the vehicle being passed
must not increase speed until the passing vehicle has completed its maneuver.
It is against the law to flash turn signals as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to other drivers.
Driving off the pavement or main traveled part of the road is not allowed when passing another
vehicle on the right or the left. When passing a pedestrian who is walking on the road or shoulder
of the roadway, a driver must keep a minimum of 3 feet between the vehicle and the pedestrian.
When passing a bicyclist on any road, including a bicyclist on the road shoulder or in a
dedicated bicycle lane, a driver must keep a minimum distance of 3 feet from the bicyclist.
Drivers may pass on the right (but not on the shoulder except for authorized vehicles):
• When they have enough room on a two-lane roadway, and when the vehicle being passed
is making or is about to make a left turn.
• On a one-way street or on a roadway with two or more clear lanes in each direction.
• At an intersection widened for this purpose.
Do Not Pass — Black Car is Breaking the Law
No Passing Zone Curve
Hill Railroad, Bridge, Tunnel, Viaduct
29
Passing on a two-lane, two-way roadway is not allowed:
• In an area marked for no passing by a solid yellow line or with a DO NOT PASS or NO
PASSING ZONE sign.
• On a hill or curve where it is not possible to see oncoming vehicles.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
• When the view is blocked within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct or tunnel.
• When a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk or intersection to allow a pedestrian to cross.
• In a construction zone. All constructions zones in Illinois are no passing zones.
• In any school zone located in an unincorporated area.
• In any posted school zone in an incorporated area.
• When a school bus has stopped to load or discharge passengers.
Lane Usage
Drivers must drive on the right half of the roadway except:
• When passing another vehicle moving in the same direction on a two-lane highway, interstate
highway or controlled freeway.
• When a blockage makes it necessary to drive to the left of the center line. Drivers may
drive on the left after yielding to oncoming traffic.
• On a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic.
• On a one-way street with two or more lanes of traffic.
• When directed to drive in a left lane by traffic control signs and signals on a multilane,
two-way highway.
• When crossing the center line to make a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
• When approaching a stationary emergency vehicle.
• When roadway construction is located in or in close proximity to the right lane or right
shoulder.
When driving on an interstate highway or full access controlled freeway, a driver may not
drive in the left lane(s), except when passing another vehicle. Exceptions include when:
• No other vehicle is directly behind the vehicle being driven in the left lane.
• Traffic conditions/congestion make it impractical to drive in the right lane.
• Weather conditions make it necessary to use the left lane(s).
• There is an obstruction or hazard in the right lane.
• The driver is changing lanes to yield to emergency or construction vehicles.
Additional rules apply in certain situations:
• Slow vehicles must use the right-hand lane except when passing or making a left turn.
• Weaving from lane to lane to move faster than the traffic flow is unlawful.
• Traffic must travel in the direction of posted one-way streets or roadways. This rule does
not apply to police and emergency vehicles using sirens or flashing lights.
• It is unlawful to drive across median strips such as unpaved strips or median barriers. A
driver may turn left across a paved dividing-space unless it is not permitted by a traffic
control sign or signal.
30
• A driver must not enter or leave any controlled-access roadway except at a posted entrance
or exit.
• A driver may not back up on any shoulder or roadway of any controlled access roadway.
• A driver may not back up on other roadways unless it is done safely and does not interfere
with other vehicles.
• A driver or passenger may not open doors on the side of a vehicle on which traffic is
moving unless it can be done safely and without interfering with vehicle or bicycle traffic.
The door may remain open only long enough to load or unload passengers. Drivers should
consider using their right hand to open the vehicle door as this gives them the opportunity
to turn and check for oncoming vehicles and bicyclists. This is more commonly known as
the Dutch Reach. A graphic of this movement can be found on page 43.
Signaling
In a business or residential area, a driver must give a continuous turn signal for at least 100
feet before turning. In other areas, the signal must be given at least 200 feet before turning.
A driver may signal in two ways:
• Electrical turn signals — A driver should apply the right-turn signal for a right turn
and the left-turn signal for a left turn.
• Hand and arm signals — A driver should give the signal using the left arm. For a right
turn, the hand and arm are extended straight up. For a left turn, the hand and arm are extended
straight out to the left. To slow down or stop, the hand and arm are extended down.
Turning
Right Turns
When making a right turn, a driver should:
• Give a right-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check traffic approaching from the left.
• Follow the general curve of the curb while making the right turn. The driver should stay
as close as possible to the curb.
• Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway the driver is entering.
Right Turn Left Turn Slow or Stop
31
• Be aware that trucks and buses may need more space to make a right-hand turn.
• Be aware of any bike lanes and check for bicyclists approaching the intersection.
Left Turns
When making a left turn, a driver should:
• Give a left-turn signal from the proper turning lane.
• Obey traffic signs and signals.
• Yield the right of way to pedestrians, emergency vehicles and other vehicles in the intersection.
• Check all approaching traffic.
• Point the wheels straight ahead until starting to make the turn.
• Complete the turn into the lane closest to the intended direction.
Changing Lanes
When moving a vehicle from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane, drivers should check
for traffic behind the vehicle and to the left by turning their head and visually assessing the
area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the left-turn signal and carefully move into
the left lane.

the area. If the area is clear, the driver should give the right-turn signal and carefully move
into the right lane.
U-Turns
Drivers must not turn around on curves and hills unless they can see for at least 500 feet
in all directions. Municipalities may prohibit U-turns on some roadways.
Hazard Signal
Both turn signals may be flashed at the same time by a driver to indicate a disabled or
parked vehicle.
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
The two-way left turn lane provides a safe area for cars making left turns at intersections
or for cars turning left into or out of a drive located in the middle of the block.
Turns and Lane Changes in Construction Zones
A driver should pay special attention to signs, barricades and pavement markings when
turning or changing lanes.
Rotaries and Roundabouts
A rotary or roundabout is an intersection where traffic travels around a central island in a
circular, counter-clockwise direction. Roundabouts may have more than one lane of traffic.
Vehicles entering or exiting a roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians and
bicycles. When drivers approach a roundabout, they should slow down and:
• Look for signs and any pavement markings prohibiting certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout by turning right when safe to do so.
• Stay in their lane.
• Use their vehicle’s right turn signal to let other drivers know they are exiting the roundabout.
Some tips for safely maneuvering in a rotary or roundabout include:
• A driver should look for street and direction signs when approaching and before entering
a roundabout. This will help determine which exit to take. These signs should be posted
along the roadside before reaching the roundabout.
• Drivers should not change lanes or take an exit before checking for vehicles that may be
continuing through the roundabout. A driver should expect vehicles to be in blind spots
where they cannot be seen in rearview or side mirrors.
Special Stops
School Buses
The only time a vehicle is not required to stop for a school bus is when both vehicles are
on a four-lane roadway and the bus is stopped in the opposite direction from which a driver
is traveling.
33
Any other time, a driver must stop before meeting
or overtaking (passing) a school bus that is stopped
and loading or unloading passengers. This includes:
• Any two-lane roadway, in rural areas and
within city limits.
• Any roadway, highway or private road.
• Any parking lot located on school property.
A warning will be given by the school bus at least
100 feet (200 feet in rural areas) in advance of a stop. The bus driver will flash lights on the
front and rear of the bus. The school bus stop signal arm will be extended after the school
bus has come to a complete stop. A driver approaching a school bus from the opposite direction
must come to a complete stop and remain stopped until the stop signal arm is no longer extended
and the flashing lights are turned off or the school bus driver signals vehicles to pass.
A conviction for passing a stopped school bus with flashing lights and the stop arm extended
will result in the suspension of an individual’s driver’s license. If the owner(s) of the vehicle
were not driving when the offense occurred, they must provide the State’s Attorney’s Office
with the name of the person driving the vehicle or their vehicle registration will be suspended
for three months.
Railroad Crossing
A driver must yield the right of way to any approaching train or railroad equipment.
When approaching a railroad crossing, a driver must stop within 15-50 feet if there is a
posted stop sign, the electric signal is flashing or the crossing gate is lowered. A driver
also must stop if a flagger issues a signal to stop or a train is approaching and/or gives a
warning. A driver may proceed only after the gate is all the way up, the lights are no longer
flashing or the flagger has signaled traffic to proceed. A driver should visually check all the
tracks for any additional oncoming trains or railroad equipment before proceeding.
If a railroad crossing has no warning devices or only a crossbuck sign (see page 78 for an
example of a crossbuck), a driver should slow down, look in both directions of the track and
listen for a train or railroad equipment. If safe to do so, a driver should then proceed with
caution across the railroad crossing.
Drivers may not enter a highway railroad crossing unless there is sufficient space on the
other side of the crossing to accommodate their vehicle without obstructing passage of a
train or other railroad equipment using the rails.
Vehicles required by law to stop at most all railroad crossings are vehicles carrying people
for hire, school buses and vehicles carrying hazardous materials.
If a vehicle becomes disabled and is stuck or stalls on railroad tracks, everyone in the vehicle
should get out immediately, call 9-1-1 and move away from the tracks at a 45 degree angle
in the direction of the train. This action keeps everyone
safe from the forward flying debris if the train strikes the
vehicle. If possible, the driver or one of the passengers
should call the railroad Emergency Notification System.
This number is located on the blue sign affixed to the railroad
crossing post near the tracks.
The following are important laws and safety tips when approaching
a railroad crossing:
• Drive as though expecting a train on any track at any
time.
• Once a train has passed, always look for a second train
on another track before proceeding.
• Check carefully to make sure there is enough room for a
vehicle on the other side of the railroad track. If there is not enough room, a driver should
not cross the tracks.
• If a vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before reaching the tracks. To avoid
stalling, do not change gears while crossing the track.
• Never race a train.
• Be prepared to stop when behind vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings.
Alleys/Driveways
In urban areas, a driver must come to a complete stop when moving out of an alley, building,
private road or driveway, and before entering the sidewalk area. If there is no sidewalk, a
driver should stop at a point nearest the street or roadway where there is a view of approaching
traffic. After stopping, a driver should yield the right of way to pedestrians and
all vehicles. If drivers are making a turn from the alley or driveway, they should use the appropriate
turn signal indicating the intended direction.
Parking
Hill Parking
Any time drivers park on a hill, they should put the gear select in park and set the
parking/emergency brake if necessary. When starting a vehicle from an uphill or downhill

location, a driver should release the parking/emergency brake, give the correct signal, check
for oncoming traffic and proceed when it is safe to do so.
• If drivers park on a street with curbing and the vehicle is facing downhill, they should turn
the front wheels toward the curb so the vehicle will roll toward the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park facing uphill and there is a curb, they should turn the front wheels away
from the curb. (See page 34.)
• If drivers park on a street without curbing, they should turn the wheels toward the side
of the road on which the vehicle is parked. (See page 34.)
Parallel Parking
When parking on streets with two-way traffic, a driver should park so the right-hand wheels
are parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb. On a one-way street or road, the vehicle
should be parked within 12 inches of the right or left curb. Vehicles must be parked in the
direction in which traffic is moving.
Parking for Persons with Disabilities
Vehicles displaying license plates or parking placards for persons with
disabilities may use spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. The
authorized holder of the parking placard or license plates must be present
and must enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges
are being used. A striped area on the pavement next to the disabled
parking space is part of the reserved space and vehicles may not use
this striped area for parking even if they have a disabled parking placard
or disability license plates. More information on this program is available
on page 94.
Parking for Electric Vehicles
Some parking areas may have spaces equipped with charging stations for electric vehicles.
Only electric vehicles are allowed to park in these designated spaces.
Prohibited Stopping, Standing or Parking
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited in specified places. Local stopping, standing and
parking regulations may be posted on signs. There are, however, statewide regulations that
are not always indicated by signs.
Stopping, standing or parking is prohibited:
• On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (also known as double parking).
• On a sidewalk, crosswalk or within an intersection.
• Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb.
• In a marked, buffered or barrel protected bike lane.
• Beside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction if the vehicle would block traffic.
• On any bridge, overpass, railroad track or within a highway tunnel.
• On any controlled access roadway — one where a vehicle may enter or exit only at certain
points.
36
• In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers.
• On a paved roadway or highway outside business or residential districts when it is practical
to stop or park off the roadway. In an emergency, drivers may stop their vehicle and park
only if there is a clear view for 200 feet in each direction. The driver should turn on the
emergency flashers and make sure there is enough space for other vehicles to pass.
• At any place where official signs prohibit stopping, standing or parking.
Standing or parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• In front of a public or private driveway.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
• Within 20 feet of a fire station driveway or crosswalk at an intersection.
• Within 30 feet of a STOP sign, YIELD sign or traffic control signal.
Parking a vehicle, whether occupied or not, is prohibited:
• Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing.
• On a highway between sunset and sunrise unless the front and rear parking lights are
displayed or the vehicle is within an urban district where lights are not required. Headlights
on parked vehicles must be dimmed.
Additional Laws
Motorists should familiarize themselves with local laws as they may vary between municipalities.
Illinois law states a driver or individual may not:
• Cause an object to fall from an overpass or other elevated location in the direction of a
moving vehicle with the intent to strike it.
• Drive on a sidewalk except when it is part of a driveway.
• Overload a vehicle with passengers or freight so that the driver’s view is obstructed.
There should be no more people in the front and rear seats as there are seat belts.
• Ride in a house trailer while it is being moved on a street or highway.
• Operate or permit to be operated any sound system (radio, tape player or disc player) at
a volume that can be heard 75 feet or more from a vehicle being driven on a highway.

Chapter 5: Sharing the Road
The driver of a passenger vehicle must share the road with many types of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Pedestrians
Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for traffic safety. A driver should always be
prepared to yield the right of way and should not drive unnecessarily close to pedestrians.
When crossing at any place other than a marked or unmarked crosswalk, pedestrians must
give the right of way to drivers. This includes between closely spaced intersections where
traffic signals are in operation. A pedestrian tunnel or pedestrian crossing bridge should
be used when available.
Pedestrians must not walk on a roadway unless there is no sidewalk or shoulder next to it.
Under these conditions, pedestrians should always walk as far from the outside edge of
the road as possible. In two-way traffic, pedestrians should walk facing oncoming traffic.
If a highway does not have a sidewalk but has a shoulder, pedestrians should always walk
on the shoulder as far from the roadway as possible. Pedestrians should not walk on a highway
when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
Pedestrians With Disabilities
When approaching a pedestrian with a disability who is utilizing a guide dog, a white cane,
a wheelchair or other assistive device on a sidewalk or roadway, the disabled person has
the right of way and is granted the same rights as any pedestrian.
Joggers/Walkers
Joggers/walkers should use jogging paths when provided. On public roads, joggers/walkers
should try to select wide roads with good shoulders. They should face oncoming traffic and
remember to look and listen for cars. At night or any time visibility is poor, joggers/walkers
should be in well-lit areas and wear reflective clothing.
Other Safety Concerns
• Pedestrians must always obey railroad and bridge gates and other barriers.
• Standing on the roadway to ask for a ride (hitchhiking) is illegal.
• Pedestrians should not stand on or next to a highway to ask drivers or passengers for
any type of money or business.
• Pedestrians ages 18 or older may skate on public roadways where the posted speed limit
is 45 mph or less from sunrise to sunset as long as vehicular traffic is not impeded or obstructed.
41
Children
To ensure the safety of children, drivers and parents should:
• Watch for signs that mark special hazard areas, such as school zones, bus stops, playgrounds,
parks and schools.
• Be ready to reduce speed in residential areas, school areas and places where children
are most likely to be.
• Be extremely watchful when backing in or out of a driveway when children are near.
• Teach children the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians at an early age.
• Assign play areas for children. Parents should make sure children do not play in or near
streets, driveways or other dangerous areas.
Motorcycles
Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Because
of their size and vulnerability in a crash, it is important for a driver to pay special attention
to motorcycles.
Intersections
More than 50 percent of all motorcycle crashes occur at intersections. The most common
situation occurs when an oncoming automobile makes a left turn in front of a motorcycle.
A vehicle driver should watch for motorcycles before turning and yield the right of way. A
driver should be particularly careful when making a left turn across lanes of oncoming traffic
and should wait to be sure of the motorcycle operator’s intent before proceeding to make
a left turn.
Stoplights
If a red light fails to turn green after 120 seconds, a motorcyclist may proceed through an
intersection after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic.
Visibility
The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the most common
cause of motorcycle crashes. Due to their small size, motorcycles may be difficult to see
and motorists tend to underestimate their speed. A driver should expect to see motorcycles
in traffic at any time, not just in the spring and summer. Drivers involved in crashes often
report not seeing the motorcycle or seeing it too late to avoid a collision.
Lane Sharing
Traffic conditions and road surfaces will determine the area within the lane that the motorcyclist
will use. Oil spills, potholes, gravel or debris may require the motorcyclist to adjust
positions within the lane. Although there may be enough room in the traffic lane for an automobile
and a motorcyclist, a vehicle driver should remember that the motorcyclist needs
the room to maneuver safely and is entitled to the entire lane. A vehicle driver should not
share the lane with motorcyclists.
42
Passing
When being passed by a motorcycle, vehicle drivers should maintain their lane position and
speed and allow the motorcycle to complete the maneuver. The vehicle driver should then
assume proper lane position as quickly as possible.
Following Distance
A vehicle driver should allow at least three to four seconds following distance when behind
a motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver in an emergency. In dry
conditions, motorcycles can stop more quickly than a car. Vehicle drivers should dim their
headlights when following all vehicles, including motorcycles.
Stopping Distance
Motorcycles can stop in a shorter distance than a car. A motorcyclist’s ability to stop quickly
also may depend on the rider’s experience and training.
Road Conditions
Motorcycles react differently to traffic, weather and road conditions than cars. Riders may
respond in ways a vehicle driver does not expect. Wet or icy roads impair a motorcyclist’s
ability to brake and maneuver. Wind gusts, both natural and those created by large passing
vehicles, can move a motorcycle across an entire lane if the rider is not prepared. Potholes
or railroad tracks often require motorcyclists to change positions within their lane. Gravel
roads decrease traction and may cause a rider to slow down or brake where a car would
not.
In Case of a Crash
Motorcyclists may only be protected by a helmet, eye protection, boots, gloves and durable
clothing. In the event of a crash, use extreme caution and seek emergency medical assistance.
More information on motorcycle safety is available in the Illinois Motorcycle Operators
Manual, which is available at any Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
Autocycles
An autocycle is a three-wheeled vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does
not require the driver to straddle or sit astride it. This type of vehicle may be operated on
Illinois roadways when correctly titled and registered with the Secretary of State. The operator
of the vehicle must have a valid Illinois driver’s license to legally operate the vehicle.
Bicycles
Manual, Gas or Electric Powered
On most roadways, bicyclists (including those on electric bikes or gas driven bicycles that
do not exceed 20 mph) have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users
including the right of way.
43
The following are important laws and safety tips regarding bicyclists:
• Some municipalities have roadways with designated bike lanes. Vehicles are not allowed
to drive, park, idle drop off or pick up passengers in these bike lanes even if bicyclists
are not present.
• Bicyclists may need to ride outside a bike lane and drivers should be prepared to safely
move around them.
• Bicyclists are prohibited on controlled-access highways, expressways and certain other
marked roadways.
• Bicyclists are required to travel in the same direction as vehicles.
• Bicyclists should travel just to the right of faster moving traffic. However, certain hazards
such as rough surfaces, debris, drainage grates or a narrow traffic lane may require bike
riders to move toward the center of the lane.
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle.
• When passing a bicyclist, motorists must do so slowly and leave at least 3 feet of passing
space from the edge of the vehicle’s side mirror. If there is not 3 feet of passing space,
drivers must wait to pass until they can do so safely. If a driver passes too close to a bicyclist
and it results in a crash, the driver may face criminal charges.
• Crowding or threatening a bicyclist is prohibited.
• When following bicyclists, a driver should give them plenty of room and be prepared to
stop quickly. Extra caution should be used during bad weather.
• High beam lights should not be used at night when approaching an oncoming bicyclist.
•When motorists are turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from
the opposite direction, they should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn.
If motorists are sharing the left-turn lane with bicyclists, they should stay behind them
until the bicyclists have safely completed their turn.
• If motorists are turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, they should let
the bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn. A driver should
remember to signal when turning.
• Low-speed electric or gas bicycles must have a motor of less than one horsepower and
must be operated by a person who is at least age 16.
• Low-speed electric and gas bicycles may only be driven on streets and may not exceed
20 mph. They may not be driven on sidewalks.
• Low-speed and electric bicycles must follow all
laws applicable to bicyclists.
• After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a
motorist should first check for bicyclists. Drivers
should consider reaching with their right hand to
open the vehicle door as this gives them a better
opportunity to check their surroundings for oncoming
vehicles and bicyclists.
A low-speed electric bicycle is a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric
motor of less than 750 watts. Low-speed electric bicycles may operate on any authorized
highway, street or roadway, including bicycle lanes and bike paths. They may
not be operated on sidewalks. Local authorities may prohibit the use of low-speed electric
44
bicycles on roadways or bike paths within their jurisdiction.
There are three classes of low-speed electric bicycles:
• Class 1— Equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling
and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 2 — Equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle but
not capable of engaging when a bicycle reaches 20 mph.
• Class 3 — Equipped with a motor that engages only when the rider is pedaling and to
provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 28 mph. Operators must be at least age 16.
Persons may operate a Class 3 low-speed electric bicycle only if they are 16 years of age
or older. A person who is under 16 years of age may ride as a passenger on a Class 3 lowspeed
electric bicycle that is designed to accommodate passengers.
For more information, an Illinois Bicycle Rules of the Road booklet is available at any local
Driver Services facility or at www.cyberdriveillinois.com. Visit www.bikesafetyquiz.com for
more information on vehicle and bicycle safety.
Scooters and Mopeds
Only motor-driven cycles and motorcycles properly titled and registered in Illinois may be
legally operated on Illinois roadways. A scooter within one of these categories may be titled
and registered in Illinois if it displays a federal safety certification label in addition to a vehicle
identification number (VIN).
A scooter or moped driver must obey all signs, signals and traffic laws and is subject to
most laws regarding the use of bicycles. Mopeds or scooters carrying two people must be
equipped with a seat and footrest for the passenger. If driven at night, it must have a headlight
visible from at least 500 feet and a taillight on the rear that is visible from at least
100-600 feet.
To determine what type of driver’s license is required to operate a scooter or moped on Illinois
roadways, a driver should follow these guidelines:
• If the scooter has an engine with less than 150cc displacement, it is a motor-driven cycle
and a Class L motorcycle license is required.
• If the scooter has an engine with 150cc displacement or greater, it is a motorcycle and a
Class M license is required.
• A moped is a motor-driven cycle that has a maximum attainable speed in one mile or
less of 30 mph and produces two-brake horsepower or less. A moped may be operated
with any valid Illinois driver’s license. If a combustion engine is used, it may not exceed
50cc displacement and may not require the operator to shift gears.
Large Vehicles
When sharing the road with trucks, buses or other large vehicles, a driver of a smaller vehicle
should:
45
• Stay out of blind spots and maintain a visible position when
following a large vehicle. Drivers of large vehicles should be
able to see surrounding vehicles in their side mirrors.
• Pay close attention to turn signals and give large vehicles
plenty of room to maneuver and make turns. Large vehicles
make wide right turns and sometimes leave an open space to
the right just before the turn.
• Always allow extra space for large vehicles. Size and weight
can affect a large vehicle’s ability to maneuver and stop.
• Always dim headlights when following a truck at night. Bright
lights will blind the drivers of large vehicles when they reflect
off the large side mirrors.
• Blink the vehicle’s headlights when passing a truck to let the truck driver know, especially
at night. The truck driver may make it easier by staying to the far side of the lane. The
pass should be completed as quickly as possible to avoid staying alongside the truck.
Disabled Vehicles
When drivers approach any disabled vehicle using hazard lights on a four-lane highway,
Illinois law requires drivers to change lanes away from the disabled vehicle if it is safe to
do so. If it is not safe to change lanes, the driver should reduce speed when approaching
and passing the disabled vehicle. Speed should not be increased until well past the disabled
vehicle.
Illinois law states a person may not:
• Push a disabled vehicle on a rural highway unless there is an emergency and it should
be removed to avoid a hazard.
• Remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from the roadway without removing all glass and
other debris.
• Tow one vehicle with another except by a drawbar. In most cases, the distance between
the two cars should not exceed 15 feet. A towed vehicle also should be coupled to the
towing vehicle with two chains or cables.
Illinois law requires a disabled, unattended or abandoned vehicle to be removed from the
roadway as soon as possible. Law enforcement may request a vehicle be towed at the
owner’s expense if it has been left along a roadway after a certain period of time.
• Interstate, Expressway or Toll Highway – after two hours.
• Highway in an urban area – after 10 hours.
• Highway in a non-urban area – after 24 hours.
Low-Speed Vehicles
A low-speed vehicle is any four-wheeled vehicle that has a federal safety certification label
in addition to a vehicle identification number (VIN). Low-speed vehicles can have a maximum
46
speed of 25 mph. Low-speed vehicles must be titled and registered in the same manner as
any other vehicle. Low-speed vehicles may operate on any street with a posted speed limit
of 30 mph or less, unless prohibited by the local municipality. Low-speed vehicles must be
equipped with the following:
• Parking brake.
• Steering wheel.
• Tires.
• Windshield.
• Safety belts.
• Rearview mirror.
• Exterior rearview mirror – mounted on driver’s side of the vehicle.
• Red reflectors – mounted on each rear side of the vehicle and one in the middle.
• Headlight – visible for 500 feet from the front.
• Taillights – red light visible for 100 feet from the rear.
• Brake lights.
• Front and rear turn signals.
NOTE: Definitions of this equipment are available on page 88.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment and animal-drawn vehicles may
share the roadways. A driver should use caution and prepare to slow down when approaching
and passing slow-moving vehicles from the rear. An orange slow-moving vehicle emblem
must be on the rear of certain slow-moving vehicles. (See page 72.)
Closing Speeds
Normal speeds for slow-moving vehicles may range from 5-20 mph. When a vehicle traveling
at normal highway speed approaches a slow-moving vehicle from the rear, the speed
differential will dramatically shorten the time it takes to reach the slow-moving vehicle.
Turns and Passing
Slow-moving vehicles may make wide turns and may turn right or left at any time into unmarked
entrances. A driver should stay a safe distance behind a slow-moving vehicle when
approaching it from the rear and only pass when it is safe to do so. Drivers should be certain
that the slow-moving vehicle operator is aware of their presence and intent to pass before
beginning the maneuver.
Rear Light
When lights are required, a flashing amber signal must be mounted as high as possible on
the rear of the vehicle. It must be visible for 500 feet in sunlight. Other devices to identify
slow-moving vehicles may include reflectors or rotating or oscillating amber lights.
47
Lane Usage
Slower traffic must drive in the right lane. The left lane is for passing and turning. Slowmoving
vehicles may be wider than the lane width so it may be necessary for these vehicles
to temporarily move into an adjoining lane to avoid roadside obstructions.
Snowmobiles
During the winter, a driver may share the roadway with snowmobiles. A driver should use
care when driving in areas with snowmobile warning signs. Information on snowmobile
registration and operating requirements is available by calling the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources at 866-867-3542 or by visiting www.dnr.illinois.gov.
Horseback Riders
Horseback riders may use public roadways. The exceptions are controlled-access highways
and most expressways. Horseback riders must ride in the same direction as other traffic
and as far to the right as possible. A driver should never sound a horn when near a horse
or other livestock as the sound may frighten it and cause a crash. When meeting or passing
a horseback rider, a driver should do so with caution and be prepared to stop.

Chapter 6: Driving Under the Influence
Alcohol is the number one killer on American roadways. Alcohol affects a person’s vision
and slows reaction time so it takes longer to act in an emergency. Alcohol affects a person’s
driving even if they are below the level of illegal intoxication. Drinking even a small amount
of alcohol increases the chances of causing a crash.
Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
Blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measurement of the amount of alcohol in a person’s
system based on a test of breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance. It is illegal to drive
if a person’s BAC is .08 percent or more. However, a person can be convicted of Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) when the BAC is less than .08 percent but driving ability is impaired.
BAC can be affected by:
• The amount a person drinks — 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard
liquor contain the same amount of alcohol.
• A person’s body weight or size. Usually, heavier people have more blood and body fluids
to dilute the alcohol.
Other factors affect a person’s reaction to alcohol, including the food recently eaten, tolerance
of alcohol and any drugs consumed. Time is the only way to remove the effects of alcohol.
Food, coffee and showers do not speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body.
Medical Cannabis (Marijuana)
Illinois law allows for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Individuals authorized to
use cannabis must be registered with the Illinois Department of Public Health and secure a
written certification from a physician licensed in Illinois. The Department of Public Health will
issue a registry ID card, and a notation will be made on the registrant’s Illinois driving record.
A driver may not operate a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis prescribed
for medicinal purposes and may not transport medical cannabis in a vehicle unless it is
stored in a tamper-evident container and kept in an area that is inaccessible while the vehicle
is in motion. If a police officer stops a vehicle driven by a person who holds a medical
cannabis registry card and the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person is impaired
by the use of cannabis, the driver must submit to field sobriety testing. Refusal to
submit to testing or failure of the field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the
person’s driver’s license.
Driving while impaired by the use of medical cannabis or driving with an open container
may result in the loss of driving privileges as well as revocation of the driver’s medical
cannabis card.
49
Other Drugs
In addition to alcohol and cannabis, many prescription and nonprescription drugs impair
safe driving. These drugs include but are not limited to: antihistamines, cold remedies, pain
relievers, mood-changing drugs, hashish, LSD, heroin, cocaine, morphine, amphetamines
(pep pills) and methamphetamines. Mixing even small amounts of alcohol with other drugs
is very dangerous. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with a cannabis
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (THC) of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of
whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily substance. It is illegal to
operate a motor vehicle on Illinois highways with any trace of a controlled drug, substance
or intoxicating compound in the blood.
DUI Laws
Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that is classified in Illinois as a violent
crime. If drivers are convicted of DUI, the offense will permanently remain on their driving
record. If drivers are arrested and/or convicted, they may lose their driving privileges, vehicle
registration, be fined and/or imprisoned.
Implied Consent Law
When operating on Illinois roadways, a driver automatically consents to submit to certain
tests. These can include breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance tests to determine
if a driver has been drinking or using any other drug or intoxicating compound before or
while driving. Illinois drivers may have a qualified person of their choice administer additional
tests at their own expense. If a person is involved in a personal injury crash or a crash
resulting in the death of another person, law enforcement officers may have probable cause
to believe a driver was impaired and must request a drug or alcohol test.
If a driver refuses to take a breath test or if an officer believes that a blood test may disclose
the presence of drugs, the driver may be held financially liable up to $500 for the costs of
the blood tests if found guilty of DUI.
Statutory Summary Suspension/Revocation Law
If a chemical test discloses a BAC of .08 percent or more, a THC level of either 5 nanograms
or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more per milliliter of other bodily
substance, driving privileges will be suspended for six months. This also applies to any
amount of a drug substance or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If a driver refuses
to submit to chemical testing, driving privileges will be suspended for one year.
Drivers who have a statutory summary suspension/revocation from Illinois, a suspension
for refusing a chemical test from another state within the last five years, court supervision
50
for DUI or a conviction for DUI are considered a second offender and will have their driving
privileges suspended for three years for refusal of chemical testing or one year for failure
of chemical testing. A test refusal may be used as evidence against a driver. At the time of
arrest, the officer will take the driver’s license and, if valid, provide the driver with a temporary
receipt allowing the individual to drive for 45 days. The statutory summary suspension
begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer and will not be
terminated until the driver pays the reinstatement fee and the driving record is updated.
If a driver refuses to submit to chemical testing after being involved in a crash where serious
personal injury or death was involved, driving privileges will be revoked for a minimum of
one year.
DUI Conviction
In addition to a statutory summary suspension/revocation, a driver may be convicted of driving
under the influence of alcohol, other drugs and/or intoxicating compounds.
A DUI conviction results in a revocation of driving privileges:
• A first conviction results in a minimum one-year revocation.
• A second conviction within 20 years results in a minimum five-year revocation.
• A third conviction results in a minimum 10-year revocation.
• A fourth and subsequent conviction results in a lifetime revocation.
A person convicted of DUI with a BAC of .16 percent or more, or DUI while transporting a
child under age 16, is subject to enhanced penalties, including additional fines, community
service and jail time.
A DUI conviction also requires a driver to file Financial Responsibility Insurance (SR-22) for
three years. Before driving privileges are restored, the person must undergo an alcohol/drug
evaluation, successfully complete a rehabilitation or alcohol/drug education program, have
an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State, pay a reinstatement fee and/or meet
other requirements.
If an Illinois resident is convicted of DUI or refuses to submit to alcohol/drug testing in another
state, the conviction or refusal will be reported to the Secretary of State’s office and
be reflected on the person’s driving record. The offender will face administrative action
against their driving privileges the same as if they were convicted of a DUI or refused chemical
testing in Illinois.
Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)
All Illinois drivers who are a first-time DUI offenders, and wish to obtain and are eligible,
may apply for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP). An MDDP requires a Breath Alcohol
Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) to be installed on their vehicle(s) at an approved installation
site as a condition of driving relief during a statutory summary suspension period.
51
Unless declared indigent, the DUI offender is responsible for all costs associated with issuance
of a permit and installation and monitoring of the BAIID.
The Secretary of State’s office monitors the BAIID throughout the duration of the permit.
The BAIID will alert the Secretary of State’s office if the driver attempts to start the vehicle
after drinking alcohol or tampers with the device.
A first-time DUI offender may choose not to petition for a Monitoring Device Driving Permit
and instead choose to refrain from driving during the suspension period. A DUI offender
who chooses not to participate in the program and is subsequently caught driving a vehicle
during the suspension period is guilty of a Class 4 felony.
Related DUI Offenses
Aggravated DUI
Drivers may be charged with Aggravated DUI if they:
• Are involved in a death or personal injury crash while driving under the influence.
• Have received a third or subsequent DUI.
• Committed DUI while driving a school bus with children or operating a vehicle for hire
such as a limousine.
• Committed DUI without a valid driver’s license, permit or vehicle insurance.
• Received a DUI after a previous history of reckless homicide or Aggravated DUI involving
a death.
Illegal Transportation of Alcoholic Beverages/Open Container
It is illegal for anyone to drink alcoholic beverages in a vehicle. The driver and passengers
may be issued a traffic citation. Passengers on chartered buses used for nonschool purposes,
motor homes, mini motor homes and limousines are exempt. It is illegal to have alcohol in
the passenger area of a vehicle if the container has been opened. If there is a second offense
within one year, a person’s driver’s license will be suspended for one year. Any driver under
age 21 also faces the loss of driving privileges for one year for the first conviction and revocation
of driving privileges for a subsequent conviction while under age 21.
Operating a Motorboat While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
It is illegal to operate a motorboat under the influence of alcohol, drugs or intoxicating compounds.
Individuals who are involved in a motorboat crash where injuries or death occur may
lose their driving privileges for refusing to submit to chemical testing to determine their BAC.
Driving privileges may also be lost for submitting to testing that discloses a BAC of .08; a
THC level of either 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or
more per milliliter of other bodily substance; any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act; or intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Protection Act.
52
Parental Responsibility
It is illegal for a parent or legal guardian to allow persons under age 21 to consume alcoholic
beverages or fail to control access to alcohol on their private property or on any property
under their control including a vehicle or water craft. If a death or personal injury occurs as
a result of consumption, the parent or legal guardian may face criminal penalties.
Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License (for DUI, Aggravated DUI, Reckless
Homicide, or Leaving the Scene of a Fatal or Personal Injury Crash)
Drivers who are convicted of driving while their license is revoked or suspended for the
above offenses will:
• Be subject to criminal penalties including jail time,
• Have the suspension or revocation period extended.
• Have their vehicle seized and possibly forfeited.
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked due to a conviction
for DUI, reckless homicide, or leaving the scene of a fatal or personal injury crash is
not allowed to drive a motor vehicle in ANY state. If a suspended or revoked Illinois driver
is arrested for driving on a suspended or revoked license in another state, that arrest will
be reported to the Secretary of State’s office.
Contributing to a DUI
It is illegal for drivers to allow their vehicle to be driven by someone they know to be under
the influence. If convicted of providing alcohol to a person under age 21, a person may be
fined up to $2,500, be given a jail sentence of up to one year and have their driving privileges
suspended.
Drivers Under Age 21
In Illinois, the minimum legal drinking age is 21. Driver’s licenses for persons under age 21
are printed vertically with distinctive features. (See inside back cover.)
Drivers who are under age 21 and convicted of DUI face the revocation of driving privileges
for a minimum of two years for a first conviction.
Drivers who are under age 21, stopped and issued a citation for a traffic violation and found
to have any trace of alcohol in their system while operating a motor vehicle will have their
driving privileges suspended for three months. If they refuse to submit to testing, driving
privileges will be suspended for six months. If it is a second offense, their driving privileges
will be suspended for one year if they fail or two years if they refuse to test. The driver’s license
suspension begins on the 46th day from the notice date provided by the police officer
and will not be terminated until the driver’s license reinstatement fee is paid and the driving
record is updated.
If the driver’s license was suspended prior to age 21, the driver will be required to successfully
complete a driver remedial education course. In addition, the driver may be required
53
to submit to a complete driver’s license examination to be re-issued a driver’s license. It is
at the discretion of the investigating officer and based on test results or a test refusal
whether a traffic stop results in a Zero Tolerance or DUI charge or both. For more information
on Illinois’ Zero Tolerance laws, visit www.cyberdriveillinois.com.
All individuals under age 21 who are convicted of illegal consumption, purchase, possession
or receiving alcohol as a gift will lose their driving privileges for a minimum of six months
regardless of whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle at the time of the offense.
Any person who receives court supervision for any of these offenses will lose driving privileges
for three months.
Illinois DUI laws are constantly changing. More information is available in the Secretary of
State’s DUI Fact Book or by visiting www.cyberdriveillinois.com.

Chapter 7: Traffic Violations/Crashes
Drivers who are involved in or come upon a traffic crash should:
• Stop their vehicle in a safe, well-lit public place that does not obstruct traffic, if able to
do so.
• Help any injured person if necessary or requested.
• Call 9-1-1 immediately.
• Warn other drivers by using emergency flashers and flares if available.
• Ask all those involved for their names, addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers
and license plate numbers.
Appearing in Court
If a driver receives a ticket for a minor traffic violation, a date for a court appearance will appear
on the face of the ticket. If the driver fails to pay the ticket or to appear in court on the
date indicated, a second court date may be set a minimum of 30 days later. The clerk of the
court will send a notice to the driver at the last known address. Failure to appear on the second
date will result in the suspension of the individual’s driver’s license until the court is satisfied
and a reinstatement fee is paid. Drivers who are under age 18 and required to appear
in court must have a parent/legal guardian present at the court appearance.
An Illinois driver ticketed in another state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator
Compact has three options:
• Stay in the ticketing state and argue the case,
• Pay the fine, or
• Sign a promise to comply with the traffic ticket, which allows the driver to continue the
journey and handle the ticket by mail from home. This courtesy also is extended to nonresidents
from compact member states who are ticketed in Illinois. Failure to comply
with the signed promise to appear will result in a driver’s license suspension by the home
state’s motor vehicle department.
Crash Reports
Regardless of fault, a crash report must be filed by the driver of a vehicle if the crash involves
death, bodily injury or property damage of more than $1,500. (If any vehicle involved in the
crash is uninsured, a report must be filed for $500 or more.)
A driver has 30 minutes to report a crash after it occurs. If drivers are involved in a crash,
they should notify the police immediately. Many towns and cities require a report if a crash
occurs within their limits. If an officer is not at the scene of the crash, a report must be
made at the nearest police station as soon as possible. If in a rural area, the county sheriff
or Illinois State Police must be notified. If the driver is unable to make the report and there
is a passenger, the passenger must make the report.
55
A report also must be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. This confidential
report must be sent no later than 10 days after the crash. The form may be obtained from
a police officer or an automobile insurance agency.
Drivers who fail to report a vehicle crash may be fined up to $2,500 and given a jail sentence
of up to one year.
Unattended Vehicles
Drivers who are involved in a crash that causes damage to an unattended vehicle (no driver
or passenger present) or other property should:
• Stop their vehicle in an area away from traffic.
• Leave their name, address, phone number and license plate number on the vehicle or
property if the owner cannot be found.
• Notify police.
• Complete all required crash reports.
Leaving the Scene of a Crash
A driver convicted of leaving the scene of a crash, especially if personal injuries or death
occurs, is subject to criminal charges. In cases where a death or personal injury has occurred,
the Secretary of State’s office is required to revoke the individual’s driver’s license.
In cases where damage is more than $1,000, driving privileges will be suspended.
Safety Responsibility Law
Drivers who are at fault in a crash that resulted in death, injury or property damage and do
not have liability insurance must also meet the requirements of the Safety Responsibility
Law. This law requires the driver to post security (a guarantee of payment) to cover damages
suffered by the injured party. The Illinois Department of Transportation determines the
amount of the security. If drivers do not post the required security(s), their driver’s license
may be suspended until the lawsuit is settled. The owner(s) of the vehicle involved in the
crash also may have their license plates/vehicle registration suspended. Driver’s license or
vehicle registration privileges will remain suspended until the driver provides proof of financial
responsibility (SR-22) and maintains the insurance for a period of three years from
the date the proof is first filed.
Individuals convicted of mandatory insurance violations will lose their driving privileges for
a minimum of three months and be required to pay a $100 reinstatement fee, with no driving
permit available.
Financial Responsibility Law
Drivers are required to file proof of financial responsibility if any of the following apply:
• They receive an unsatisfied court judgment related to a crash.
56
• The driver’s license was suspended under the Safety Responsibility Law due to an uninsured
crash.
• They receive a court supervision for a mandatory insurance violation.
• They have been convicted of three or more mandatory insurance violations.
Proof of financial responsibility may include a certificate of insurance (SR-22), a bond or a
deposit of securities (such as stock certificates). The SR-22 is filed directly with the Secretary
of State by the insurance company. Through the SR-22 process, the Secretary of State
monitors insurance coverage for a period of time specified by law. Failure to renew insurance
coverage or cancellation of insurance will result in a driver’s license suspension.
Crash Prevention Courses
Drivers who are age 55 or over may receive a reduction in their motor vehicle liability insurance
if they successfully complete an eight-hour defensive driving course. Drivers may
contact their insurance agent to determine the amount of the reduction. Information about
courses is available by visiting www.aarp.org/drive.

Chapter 8: Driver’s License Revocation,
Suspension, Denial and Cancellation
Certain revocations, suspensions, denials and cancellations can remain on an individual’s
driving record permanently.
Revocation
A revocation is the indefinite withdrawal of driving privileges by the Secretary of State’s
office. To regain driving privileges, a driver may be eligible to reapply for a license after a
minimum of one year, unless otherwise noted.
The Secretary of State’s office has the authority to revoke the driver’s license of a repeat
traffic offender. During the course of any revocation, a driver’s vehicle registration may be
suspended and notice is given accordingly.

More information on actions that may cause the suspension or revocation of driving privileges
is available in the Illinois Vehicle Code.
Cancellation
Cancellation is the termination of driving privileges by formal action of the Secretary of State’s
office. Cancellation of a person’s driver’s license or permit will occur because of an error or
defect in the license or because the licensee is no longer entitled to the license. Reapplication
for a driver’s license may be made only after the terms of the cancellation have been met.
60
The reasons a driver’s license may be canceled include but are not limited to the following:
• Medical Condition — Being medically or visually unfit to safely operate a motor vehicle;
failure to submit a medical or vision report when required; and failure to self-admit
to a medical condition that may interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
• Re-examination Requirement — Failing to appear for a required re-examination; failing
a portion of the test required on a mandatory re-examination.
• Fraudulent Application — Committing a fraudulent offense in the making of a driver’s
license or ID card application.
• Ineligible — Being unentitled to the license or permit.
Denial
Denial is the temporary refusal of the privilege of applying for a driver’s license and, in certain
instances, an instruction permit. A denial can only be entered on the driving record of
an individual under age 18 for conviction of one of the following offenses:
• Mandatory Revocation of Driving Privileges for Offenses Listed on Pages 57-58
— A denial for these offenses prohibits individuals from applying for a driver’s license
or an instruction permit until their 18th birthday.
• Driving Without a Valid Driver’s License or Permit — Such a denial forbids individuals
from applying for a driver’s license until their 18th birthday, while an application
for an instruction permit is still allowed. If the person already has a driver’s license, the
driving privileges granted by that license are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Serious Moving Violation — The length of this type of denial is either nine months or
until the person’s 18th birthday, whichever is shorter. This denial only forbids an application
for a driver’s license. Instruction permit applications are still allowed. If the person already
has a driver’s license, the driving privileges granted are reduced to an instruction permit.
• Crash Involving Bodily Harm or Death — The Secretary of State’s office may deny
issuing or renewing a driver’s license if the driver has been charged with an offense due
to a crash resulting in serious injury or death of another. Alcohol need not play a factor
in the crash.
Special Driving Permits
An Illinois driver whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended may be allowed
to drive using special permits in certain cases. These permits are:
• Restricted Driving Permit (RDP) — Allows driving only during certain times and along
specified routes for work-related or educational purposes, transporting a child in the
home to and from day care or an acceptable educational institution, or to receive medical
care or drug treatment. An RDP cannot be issued to a person under age 16.
• Monitoring Device Driving Permit (MDDP) — Allows a first-time DUI offender serving
a statutory summary suspension to operate a motor vehicle. The MDDP is needed in
order for individuals to have a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) installed
on their vehicle. Issuance of the MDDP and installation of the BAIID allows drivers to
legally operate a motor vehicle at any time of day or night as long as they do not consume
61
alcohol prior to driving and do not tamper with the BAIID unit. An MDDP cannot be issued
to a person under age 18.
• Occupational Driving Permit (ODP) — Allows a professional driver whose license
has been suspended for three moving violations to operate a vehicle in conjunction with
employment. To qualify, the individual must drive for a living. This permit does not apply
to commercial drivers.
• Probationary License — Allows a driver age 21 and over, whose license has been
suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period, to operate a vehicle during
the period of suspension. The permit can be issued for no more than three months. This
is issued in conjunction with a driver improvement activity that grants full driving privileges
during a period of suspension for drivers ages 21 and over. The license may only
be issued to a person suspended for three moving violations in a 12-month period and
cannot be issued for more than three months.
• Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit (FRP) — Allows a driver whose license
was suspended for nonpayment of child support or child visitation abuse to operate
a vehicle. This permit is only issued following a circuit judge’s order or upon direction
from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Chapter 9: Roadway Signs
Along the roadway there are types of signs: regulatory, warning and guide. Each type of
sign is identified by its shape and color. Applicants will be asked to identify roadway signs
on the written driver’s license exam.
Shapes of Signs
These are the basic shapes of signs, each with a special purpose. Other shapes may be
used for special purposes.
This eight-sided red sign means STOP. A driver must make a complete
stop at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic. At an all-way STOP
sign, drivers should wait for their turn. If the STOP sign is a temporary
sign erected by highway authorities, it should be treated as if it were
a permanent STOP sign. If the STOP sign is handheld, the driver should
stop until an authorized person, such as a school guard or construction
zone flagger, signals that it is safe to proceed.
This three-sided sign means YIELD the right of way. A driver must let
all traffic and pedestrians go before proceeding. YIELD signs are red
and white.
This round sign indicates a RAILROAD CROSSING ahead. RAILROAD
CROSSING signs are yellow with a black crossbuck “X” and the letters
“RR.” It is an advance warning sign that means a railroad track will
cross the roadway ahead. In rural areas the sign may be up to 750
feet in advance of the railroad crossing. A driver should slow down,
look and stop if necessary. A driver should roll down the vehicle windows
and listen to make certain other noises do not block out the
sound of a train. If a train is approaching, the driver should stop and
wait. A driver should never race the train to the crossing.
This diamond-shaped sign means WARNING. It may be yellow, yellow-
green, or orange with black wording or symbols. This sign warns
a driver about hazards or possible hazards on or near the roadway.
Drivers should slow down and use caution when they see this type of
sign.
63
This five-sided sign is shaped like an old school house. It is yellow
or yellow-green with black symbols. It means either SCHOOL
ZONE or SCHOOL CROSSING. If the sign shows two children walking,
a school is near. If the sign shows two children walking with
a downward pointing arrow, the driver and vehicle are at a school
crossing.
This three-sided sign is yellow with black and indicates a NO PASSING
ZONE. The sign will appear on the left side of a two-lane, twoway
roadway at the beginning of the area where “no passing”
pavement markings are also used.
Squares and/or rectangles can be used either as regulatory or guide
signs.
Colors of Signs
The color on a sign has a special meaning. It is important that a driver
memorizes the meanings of the colors.
RED signs are regulatory signs and must be obeyed. They include
STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY.
Some BLACK and WHITE signs are regulatory signs and must be
obeyed. Others are used as route markers and are illustrated in the
Guide Signs section on pages 72-73.
YELLOW is used for warning signs. These signs tell a driver of road
conditions and dangers ahead.
YELLOW-GREEN can also be used for warning signs. These signs
alert a driver to pedestrian and bicycle crossings, playground areas,
school bus stops and school zones.
ORANGE is used for warning signs usually found in constructions or
maintenance zones along streets and highways. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to construction and maintenance
projects.
GREEN is used for guide signs. These signs tell drivers where they
are, which way to go and the distance to upcoming destinations.
64
BLUE also is used for guide signs. These signs tell a driver about
services along the roadway.
BROWN is used for parks and recreation signs.
PINK may be used for traffic incident signing. These signs alert a
driver to possible dangers ahead due to unplanned traffic incidents,
such as traffic crashes and natural disasters.
Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs instruct drivers on what to do. Drivers must obey these signs.
Stop
An eight-sided (octagon) sign tells a driver to always make a full stop
at the stop line. If there is no stop line, the driver should stop before
entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, the driver should
stop before entering the intersection. A driver should yield the right
of way to pedestrians and approaching traffic.
All-Way Stop
This sign means there are STOP signs at each approach to an intersection
and traffic from all directions must stop. The first driver to
stop is the first driver to go. Other drivers must wait their turn. A
driver may also see 3-WAY, 5-WAY or ALL-WAY signs underneath
the stop sign.
Yield
The three-sided (triangle) sign tells a driver to give the right of way
to all vehicles and pedestrians before proceeding. A driver should
slow down to a safe speed and stop if necessary. When stopping,
the driver must stop the vehicle at a marked crosswalk or before entering
the intersection. A driver also may see YIELD signs on expressway
ramps. These signs may be posted when there is no extra lane
where a driver may speed up to merge with expressway traffic.
Do Not Enter
This sign is posted on one-way streets and other roadways where a
driver is not allowed to enter. A driver may see this sign if attempting
to enter an expressway ramp in the wrong direction.
STOP
STOP
YIELD
65
Speed Zone Ahead
This sign warns a driver there is a speed zone ahead. Drivers should
be prepared to alter their current speed.
Speed Limit
Some signs show maximum and minimum speed limits for all types of
vehicles on freeways and controlled-access highways. Driving slower
than the minimum speed limit is illegal, unless necessary for safety.
Wrong Way
This sign tells drivers their vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction.
A driver will see this sign on expressway ramps a short distance past
the DO NOT ENTER sign. A driver also will see this sign if turning
the wrong way into a one-way street, alley or driveway.
No (Not Allowed)
Signs having a red circle with a red slash from the upper left to the
lower right mean a particular action is not allowed. The picture
within the circle shows what is not allowed.
No U-Turn
These signs are posted on divided highways or expressways. A driver
may see one where there is an opening in the divided highway that
leads to the other side. These openings are only for authorized vehicles,
such as police cars, ambulances, snow plows, construc -
tion/maintenance equipment and other emergency vehicles. Other
types of vehicles may not use this opening.
No Right/Left Turn
These signs indicate turns are not allowed in the direction shown by the arrow.

66
One-Way
These signs are used on one-way streets or driveways. A driver must
always go only in the direction of the arrow.
Two-Way Left Turn Lanes
Either of these two signs can be used to indicate
a two-way left turn lane in the center of a
highway. Along with a sign, the two-way left
turn lane is marked with yellow lines and white
arrows.
No Turn on Red
This sign is used at some intersections. It tells a driver a right turn
on a red light or a left turn on a red light at intersecting one-way
streets is prohibited. It may also show a red circle instead of the
word red.
Approaching a Divided Highway
This sign is used on approaches to a divided highway. It informs a
